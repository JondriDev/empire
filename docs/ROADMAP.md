# The Empire — Roadmap

> Single prioritized backlog the build/QA routines pull from. Re-ranked every
> strategist run against what shipped and what QA flagged. **Direction, not code.**
>
> **Vision:** one interconnected organism that feels like alien technology —
> 25 apps + a windowed desktop shell, shipped as a complete offline-first PWA
> and then an Android app. Depth and coherence over new surface area.
>
> **Priority bias (high → low):** fix what QA reports broken → interconnection
> (the living graph) → design-system consistency → completing apps → PWA → Android.
>
> Last re-ranked: **2026-07-14** (strategist) · Main: 🟢 green (`metrics.json` current: apps 31, vitest 468/65 files,
> **all six conformance axes 0 & LOCKED** — token-violations 0, off-system 0, offSystemStyle 0 r0/t0/m0, offShellControls 0
> b0/i0/s0/t0, keyboardA11y 0, docMass 0 — `--assert-zero` exit 0, bundle gz 733.8) · QA (2026-07-13, green main `d131376`):
> 32/32 render clean, all 14 guard suites green, **no runtime bug**. **EPIC-1..16 all DONE** (organism both-ways 9/9 ·
> token-violations 501→0 · shallow instruments 8/8 · PWA offline+base+installable · off-system 1076→0 CI-locked · durable
> provenance `PROVENANCE-PERSISTS 3/3`+`PROVENANCE-ENTITY 3/3` · `GLOBAL-SEARCH 1/1` · `NODE-LINEAGE 1/1` · `TIMELINE 1/1` ·
> `offSystemStyle` 56→0 LOCKED — EPIC-11 · `INTENT-ROUNDTRIP` 0/2→2/2 — EPIC-12 · Mail+Crypto joined, `GRAPH-LEGIBLE 3/3`+
> `INBOUND-LANDS 4/4` — EPIC-13 · `offShellControls` 341→0 LOCKED — EPIC-14 · `keyboardA11y` 24→0 LOCKED — EPIC-15 · `docMass`
> 3269→0 LOCKED — EPIC-16). **The organism has NO islands left AND the design-system conformance band is fully swept + gated**
> (reduced-motion is already global; the accessible-name metric was rejected as over-counting; per-app craft belongs to the App
> Artisan rotation). So the steepest remaining **systemic** gradient stays **organism depth** — one order deeper each epic:
> *legible* → *proactive* (EPIC-17/18, both DONE) → *associative* (EPIC-19, now ACTIVE).
> **✅ EPIC-17 · The Bridge becomes the organism's cockpit — DONE 2026-07-14** (`HOME-ATTENTION 0 → 6/6` LOCKED, S1–S4): a
> ranked, reasoned, one-tap-resolvable **Attention** feed on the home synthesising every app's live signals via the pure
> `computeAttention` spine. **✅ EPIC-18 · The cockpit reaches beyond the home (shell-level attention) — DONE 2026-07-14**
> (`SHELL-ATTENTION 0 → 4/4` LOCKED, S1–S2): the attention signal carried into the persistent shell — a live, urgency-tinted,
> spring-pulsing "needs you" badge on the HomeBar Home button so the organism nudges you from *inside* any app.
> **▶ EPIC-19 · The organism relates (the associative constellation) — ACTIVE, promoted 2026-07-14.** The order past *proactive*:
> from surfacing *what needs you* to revealing *how everything connects*. Every graph edge today is EXPLICIT (a handoff or an
> intent-stamped `data.from`); nothing reveals IMPLICIT relatedness. Add the **6th lens (ASSOCIATIVE)**: open any entity → its
> *constellation* of cross-app relatives (shared-term · shared-tag · same-day · already-linked), ranked + reason-labelled + one
> tap away. **Target: new `RELATED` QA guard 0 → 5/5**; pure `relatedTo` spine reusing `search.ts` + the graph. No new deps; six
> axes 0. See `docs/EPICS.md` for the S1–S4 decomposition. **Android is EPIC-7 (QUEUED)** — device-gated, promote only with on-device QA.

> **Note:** the day-to-day execution queue now lives in [`docs/EPICS.md`](./EPICS.md)
> (one ACTIVE epic, deeply decomposed stages). This ROADMAP holds the **higher-altitude
> themes** that feed *future* epics — re-ranked each strategist run.

## NOW — next 3–5 increments (each one PR-sized)

Pulled top-to-bottom. Each is small, concrete, and has an acceptance check.
(The **active epic's stages (EPIC-6 S1 → S4, Organism Memory) take precedence** — these are the on-deck themes
feeding *future* epics.)

### 1. ✅ DONE (Builder 2026-07-01) — Make the README tell the truth (26 apps, Cakra, current stack)
**Priority: DESIGN-SYSTEM CONSISTENCY / hygiene.** **Shipped:** `README.md` regenerated 1:1 from
`src/lib/registry.ts` (26 apps, correct names + AI flags; the 3 tools merged into Cakra marked as tabs),
Hermes → **Cakra** everywhere, tech-stack versions corrected against `package.json`, and the design-system
section rewritten to the real JondriDev "Earth-from-Space" Liquid Glass tokens (Sora / JetBrains Mono, `.gp`).
Acceptance met: inventory matches the registry, no stale "Hermes"/"21 apps"/"XENO"/"Inter" references remain.
_Original note (for history): the README said "21 Apps," centered a **Hermes AI** app, and omitted the newer
instruments; the product was rebranded Hermes → **Cakra** and the registry now holds **26** apps + the shell._

- **Why:** the README is the front door. A stale inventory undercuts the
  "complete, coherent organism" story and misleads anyone (or any routine)
  orienting from it.
- **Do:** regenerate the app-inventory table from `src/lib/registry.ts` (25 apps,
  correct names + AI flags), update the headline count, and replace "Hermes"
  naming with "Cakra" throughout. (Build-routine task — README lives at repo root,
  outside this strategist's docs-only scope.)
- **Acceptance:** README inventory matches `registry.ts` 1:1; no stale "Hermes AI"
  central-app references; app count is correct.

### 2. Lock the palette against future drift — **NOW FOLDED INTO EPIC-5 S8**
**Priority: DESIGN-SYSTEM CONSISTENCY.** *(No longer a standalone NOW item — it became the close-out stage of the
active epic.)* EPIC-5 S8 wires `metrics.mjs --assert-zero` into CI (fails if `tokenViolations>0 ||
offSystemUtilities>0`) and adds a `@theme`-bridge↔`colors_and_type.css` drift test, so once off-system hits 0 the
conformance is permanent. Kept here as a pointer; do not double-build.

- **Why:** EPIC-2 gets violations to 0 by sweeping; without a ratchet, the count creeps back.
  A test that ties `colors_and_type.css` `--*` vars to their `tokens.ts` consts (and a CI check
  that `metrics.mjs` token-violations stays 0) makes the conformance permanent.
- **Do:** a vitest that asserts every `--signal`/`--ion`/… CSS custom prop equals its `PALETTE`
  const, plus a `metrics.mjs --assert-zero`-style gate. (Build-routine task — outside docs scope.)
- **Acceptance:** a drift or a new hardcoded hex fails CI. Build green.

### 3. ✅ DONE / FOLDED — Deeper graph mirrors (whole-state legibility)
**Priority: INTERCONNECTION (the living graph).** Two of the three whole-state gaps are closed and the last is
now **EPIC-6 S4**:
- **Files** ✅ **DONE** (Builder 2026-06-30) — `filesGraph.ts` accumulates the session union across every visited
  directory and mirrors the whole union (was: navigating pruned prior folders). No longer forgets folders.
- **DataCenter** ✅ **already correct** — `DataCenter.tsx:57` mirrors *all* tables with per-table row counts (the
  "active table only" note predated the redesign; confirmed stale).
- **Reader** ⏳ **folded into EPIC-6 S4** — the newest app never mirrors its book collection, so it's a graph
  island; S4 closes it (mirror `book` nodes + book-level emit) as the epic's capstone.

- **Why:** "one organism where every app's real entities are legible in The Network" — a collection that only
  mirrors its active slice under-represents itself in the mesh. Files/DataCenter are done; Reader is the last gap.
- **Acceptance:** (met for Files/DataCenter) prior tables/dirs stay represented; (EPIC-6 S4) a loaded Reader book
  appears as a `book` node in The Network.

---

## NEXT — themes (break into NOW items as slots open)

- **Complete the cross-app graph.** ✅ **DONE — this WAS EPIC-1** (emit↔receive loop closed,
  both-ways 9/9; Network inspector S3, ⌘K palette S4, Inbox S5 all shipped). Retired.
- **Design-system colour conformance — full.** *(In progress — this IS EPIC-5.)* EPIC-2 zeroed raw hex/rgba
  *literals*; EPIC-5 now zeroes the **1076 off-system Tailwind palette classes** that bypass the `@theme` token
  bridge and break `[data-theme]`. Closes when `offSystemUtilities` hits 0 and S8's CI gate is live.
  **Follow-on theme (next epic candidate, not yet decomposed):** extend the conformance audit to
  **spacing/radii/type** (ad-hoc px, non-`--mono` code surfaces) with its own `metrics.mjs` row, so
  "design-system conformance" isn't colour-only.
- **Depth pass on shallow apps.** ✅ **DONE — this WAS EPIC-3** (shallow instruments 8/8 offline-capable; Clock,
  Music/Video, Photos durable + DataCenter/Weather tests). Retired.
- **PWA completion.** ✅ **DONE — this WAS EPIC-4** (cold offline boot 5/5 from precache, zero precache gap,
  base-path/install-flow correct, installability asserted). Retired.
- **Organism Memory — durable provenance & lineage.** ✅ **DONE — this WAS EPIC-6** (durable `empire-provenance`
  store, persistent Network memory panel + all-time "fed by/feeds", reload-durable per-entity source via
  `LineageTrail`, Reader graph-island closed). `PROVENANCE-PERSISTS 3/3` + `PROVENANCE-ENTITY 3/3` + `GRAPH-LEGIBLE
  1/1` all QA-confirmed. Retired.
- **Global cross-app search — the organism becomes queryable.** ✅ **DONE — this WAS EPIC-8** (S1–S3 shipped: pure
  `search.ts` spine + the Search app + `openEntity` deep-link + filters/keyboard/⌘⇧F summon; `GLOBAL-SEARCH 1/1`,
  S1–S2 QA-confirmed). Retired.
- **Node-level lineage — per-artifact ancestry.** ✅ **DONE — this WAS EPIC-9** (S1–S3 shipped: `nodeLineage.ts`
  walker + `<NodeLineage>` surface on Inbox/Network/Search + each hop navigable via `openEntity`; `NODE-LINEAGE 1/1`,
  5 axes, S1–S3 all QA-confirmed LIVE). Retired. *Left one rail dormant:* `childrenOf` (descendants) was
  built + unit-pinned but never surfaced → picked up by EPIC-10 S3.
- **The Timeline — a temporal lens over the whole organism.** ✅ **DONE — this WAS EPIC-10** (S1–S3 shipped + QA-confirmed
  LIVE: `TIMELINE 1/1`, all six axes `ordered/grouped/flow/persisted/filtered/descendants`; the 4th lens after
  Network/Search/Inbox; finally surfaced the dormant `childrenOf` descendants walker). Retired 2026-07-04.
- **Design-system conformance II — the non-colour token axis.** ✅ **DONE — this WAS EPIC-11** (S1–S4 shipped +
  QA-confirmed LIVE: `offSystemStyle 56 → 0` r0/t0/m0, radii/type/easing all tokenised + LOCKED in `--assert-zero`, the
  exact EPIC-5 measure→drive-to-0→lock template; raw spacing deliberately excluded as un-driveable). Retired 2026-07-06.
- **Intent integrity — every cross-app creation makes a REAL, persistent entity.** ✅ **DONE — this WAS EPIC-12** (S1–S3
  shipped: `make-note-from` + `add-to-learning` route through `useStore.addNote`/`addLearningItem` so the synchronous mirror
  re-materializes them un-prunably, `data.from` preserved; a reconcile-survival invariant LOCKS the phantom pattern out).
  `INTENT-ROUNDTRIP 0/2 → 2/2` QA-confirmed LIVE on green main `17d2dd9`. Retired 2026-07-09. *`make-task` stays graph-only by design.*
- **The last two islands join the organism — Mail + Crypto become first-class Empire citizens.** ✅ **DONE — this WAS EPIC-13**
  (S1–S3 shipped + QA-render-confirmed LIVE on green main `a9bec85`): `mail` + `crypto` routed onto the shared shell + the
  EPIC-6 `mirrorCollection` rail + the EPIC-1 `useInboundHandoff` rail — both graph-legible, receive, and emit. `GRAPH-LEGIBLE
  1/1 → 3/3` (crypto wallets + mail drafts) + `INBOUND-LANDS 3/3 → 4/4` (mail). Retired 2026-07-10. *The organism has no
  islands left.*
- **Shell conformance — the component shell becomes total (no app renders a bare interactive control).** ✅ **DONE — this WAS
  EPIC-14** (S1–S12, retired 2026-07-13): completed the `ui` set (`Select`/`IconButton`/`Segmented`) + migrated every offender
  file; `offShellControls 341 → 0` LOCKED in `--assert-zero`. The shell-conformance invariant lives in `src/components/ui/index.tsx`.
- **Keyboard operability (WCAG 2.1.1).** ✅ **DONE — this WAS EPIC-15** (retired 2026-07-13): every mouse-only `onClick` on a
  non-interactive host made keyboard-operable via `src/lib/a11y.ts` `onActivate`; `keyboardA11y 24 → 0` LOCKED.
- **The fleet eats its own dog food — doc-mass conformance.** ✅ **DONE — this WAS EPIC-16** (S1–S3, retired 2026-07-13): the
  user-ratified `docMass` metric (`scripts/docMassAudit.mjs` `scanDocMass`) budgets the read-every-run docs (CONTEXT ≤400,
  EPICS ≤500); `docMass 3269 → 0` LOCKED. *(The RFC's QA-infra gap — playwright→devDep + auto-server — shipped 2026-07-10.)*
- **From legible to proactive — the Bridge becomes the organism's cockpit.** ✅ **DONE — this WAS EPIC-17** (retired 2026-07-14):
  one ranked, reasoned, one-tap-resolvable **Attention** feed on the home (pure `computeAttention` spine + Bridge render +
  inline resolve/navigate); `HOME-ATTENTION 0 → 6/6` LOCKED.
- **The cockpit reaches beyond the home — shell-level attention.** ✅ **DONE — this WAS EPIC-18** (retired 2026-07-14): the
  attention signal carried into the persistent shell — a live, urgency-tinted, spring-pulsing badge on the HomeBar Home button
  (`attentionSummary` spine + `Desktop.tsx`); `SHELL-ATTENTION 0 → 4/4` LOCKED.
- **From proactive to associative — the organism relates.** *(In progress — this IS EPIC-19, ▶ ACTIVE, promoted 2026-07-14.)*
  The graph only knows EXPLICIT edges (handoffs / `data.from`); it never reveals IMPLICIT relatedness. Add the 6th lens
  (ASSOCIATIVE): a per-entity **constellation** of cross-app relatives (shared-term · shared-tag · same-day · already-linked),
  ranked + reason-labelled + navigable (pure `relatedTo` spine reusing `search.ts` + `<RelatedConstellation>` on Network/
  Timeline/Search + `RELATED 5/5` QA guard). See `docs/EPICS.md` for the S1–S4 decomposition.
- **Measured accessibility pass — LARGELY CLOSED; parking-lot.** `prefers-reduced-motion` is **already global**
  (`src/design-system.css` `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` neutralizes all CSS animation/transition; the 2 JS canvas
  surfaces already guard `matchMedia`), and the accessible-name (WCAG 4.1.2) metric was **rejected 2026-07-13** as over-counting
  (all 125 `IconButton`s already carry a TS-forced `aria-label`; an icon-only-`Button` detector flags dynamic-text children it
  can't see). What remains (focus-visible coverage, focus-trap correctness) is thin + murky to detect statically — no crisp,
  driveable 0-metric. Revisit only if a honest one emerges; per-surface a11y is Artisan-owned.
- **Design-system STATE conformance (empty / loading / error) — Artisan-owned; weak systemic metric.** `<EmptyState>` is a
  general primitive (`src/components/ui/Utility.tsx`); the App Artisan adopts honest states per-surface each run (photos/cache/
  files/language recently). An `emptyStateAdoption` count is a **"grow" metric with no natural 0 target** and "which `.map()`
  needs an empty branch" resists static detection — so it stays craft-level (Artisan rotation), NOT a Strategist drive-to-0 epic.
- **Android APK validation.** *(QUEUED EPIC-7 — renumbered EPIC-5→6→7.)* Device-gated: an unattended cloud
  builder can't install an APK or run on-device smoke, so its target isn't cloud-verifiable. Promote only when an
  on-device QA path exists; until then it's lower *realizable* gradient than the cloud-executable themes above.

## LATER — parking lot (revisit; don't build yet)

- ~~Organism-wide provenance/memory: a queryable trail of which app produced/consumed
  each artifact~~ → **PROMOTED to ▶ EPIC-6 (Organism Memory)**, 2026-07-01. App-level durable provenance is the
  active epic; the artifact-level (node-scoped) trail is the named follow-on candidate.
- ~~Global search across all app data (notes, events, learning, bookmarks, prompts)~~ → **PROMOTED to ▶ EPIC-8
  (Global cross-app search)**, 2026-07-02. S1 shipped (`GLOBAL-SEARCH 1/1`); S2–S3 deepen it.
- Multi-window desktop polish: snapping, persisted layout, per-app window state.
- Real-device QA loop (rendered UI) so the Network animations, fonts, and handoff
  arcs get visual confirmation instead of "not verifiable in cloud."
- Accessibility follow-through (the earlier a11y audit) as a measured pass.
- Optional self-hosted backend story for users who do run `server.js` (sync).

## DONE — recently shipped (trimmed each run)

- **Inbox / Today view** (EPIC-1 S5) — the 27th app aggregates every graph `task` into
  open/done buckets with a done-toggle, source chip, and ⚡ bar (`tasks.ts` seam). (2026-06-22)
- **Global ⌘K command palette** (EPIC-1 S4) — focus-aware modal over the last-touched node;
  lists `intentsFor(node)` + "Open in <app>" and runs via `runIntent` (`focus.ts`). (2026-06-22)
- **Network inspector + legend** (EPIC-1 S3) — clicking a node opens an inspector of its real
  entities + true neighbors; persistent node-type legend (`adjacency.ts`/`nodeColors.ts`). (2026-06-22)
- **Inbound provenance chips** (#23, EPIC-1 S1) — every `sessionStorage` receiver
  (Editor / Token Counter / Prompt Gen / AI Chat) shows a dismissible "From <app>"
  chip and preloads the payload; fixed Editor silently dropping its clipboard. (2026-06-22)
- **Every transfer emits an arc** (EPIC-1 S2) — all five navigating `CROSS_APP_ACTIONS`
  emit `HANDOFF{fromId,toId}`; the two in-place transfers carry `from` on their typed
  event; `appActions.test.ts` asserts exactly one arc-bearing event per action. (2026-06-22)
- **App→app synapse arcs** (#8) — handoffs light a curved link directly between
  two instruments, routed through CORE, with a packet sweep. (2026-06-20)
- **Live signal ticker** (#7) — Network mesh shows the last 6 signals as a
  glanceable nerve-traffic log. (2026-06-20)
- **Network wired to the live event bus** (#3) — `onAny()` added; the mesh pulses
  on real cross-app activity instead of a fixed timer. (2026-06-20)
- **Self-host JetBrains Mono** (#5) — last external font dependency vendored;
  renders identically offline. (2026-06-20)
- **Cakra rebrand** — Hermes → Cakra + multi-model NIM router.
- **PWA/APK packaging** — staged in PR #2 (open, human-owned; do not auto-merge).
- **QA green** — 26/26 routes mount, no runtime errors (2026-06-20T18:09Z).

## Folded from the legacy iteration backlog (2026-07-05)

`docs/ITERATION_BACKLOG.md` (pre-fleet era) was retired in the repo reshape; its
still-relevant ideas are parked here for future re-ranking:

- **Network polish** — type-colored nodes from design tokens, legible edge labels,
  hover-highlight of a node's neighbors; search/filter by node type + title substring.
- **Consistent empty-states** for every app list (icon + hint).
- **`prefers-reduced-motion`** honored across all animations.
- **Command palette** — global "⚡ Send to…" entry surfacing intents for the focused node.
- **DataCenter** — fetch per-table row counts on `loadTables` so every `dataset` node has a stable count.
- **Files** — a "pinned"/cross-directory file graph would need a persistent registry
  (today's reconcile is per-directory).
- **Prompt Gen** — optional persisted history of un-saved generations.
- ~~**Intents** — `make-note-from` / `add-to-learning` should round-trip into the
  Notes/Learning stores (today they create graph-only nodes).~~ ✅ **DONE — EPIC-12** (both route through the store, mirror
  un-prunably, reconcile-survival LOCKED; `INTENT-ROUNDTRIP 2/2`). Retired 2026-07-09.
- **Photos** — persist a data-URL thumbnail so photo nodes can be visual in Network.
