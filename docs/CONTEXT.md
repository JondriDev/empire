# The Empire — Working Memory (cross-run context)

> **Why this file exists (first principles):** every cloud routine runs on a
> *stateless fresh checkout*. Without shared memory, each run burns most of its
> budget re-deriving the codebase and re-discovering the plan — that understanding
> is dissipated at run-end (waste heat), leaving only enough energy for a sliver
> of a change. **This file conserves that energy.** Read it FIRST; write back to
> it LAST. Run N+1 should inherit the understanding run N paid for, and spend its
> whole budget on the change — that is what turns slight iterations into leaps.

**Rules for maintaining this file:**
- This is *working memory*, not a log (the chronological journal is `docs/ROUTINE-LOG.md`).
- Keep it **tight and current** — prune anything no longer true. Stale memory is worse than none.
- Builder & QA update it **every run**. Strategist refreshes the "Active epic" block when it promotes a new epic.
- Use `file.ts:line` pointers so the next run jumps straight to the seam.

## 🧹 REPO RESHAPE (2026-07-05, human session) — one-time notice, honor the rules

A professionalization pass reshaped the repo (branch `chore/pro-repo`, landed inside a
fleet freeze). What changed for routines:

- **Removed for good — do not recreate:** `docs/archive/`, `docs/ITERATION_BACKLOG.md`,
  `docs/ITERATION_PROTOCOL.md`, `docs/ENHANCEMENTS.md`, the committed `scratchpad/`
  (now gitignored), and the legacy iteration scripts (`scripts/empire`, `empire-1000.sh`,
  `empire-auto-loop.sh`, `empire-iteration.sh`, `empire.sh`, `empire_fabric_iterations.py`,
  `iterate.sh`, `pwa-launch.sh`, `install-homescreen.sh`, `test-crud.mjs`). Still-live
  backlog ideas were folded into `docs/ROADMAP.md` (tail section).
- **Moved:** `PACKAGING.md` → `docs/PACKAGING.md`; `empire.desktop` → `scripts/empire.desktop`.
- **Unchanged and still load-bearing:** CONTEXT/EPICS/ROADMAP/METRICS/ROUTINE-LOG/metrics.json,
  `docs/routines/**`, `docs/screenshots/latest/REPORT.md`, `docs/digests/`,
  `public/solver/feed.json`, every `scripts/*.mjs` guard.
- `docs/README.md` now indexes the documentation — keep it current when docs change.
- **📵 NO IMAGE FILES IN GIT — EVER.** QA screenshots are local working artifacts now:
  `docs/screenshots/latest/*.png` is **gitignored** (the 5×/day PNG overwrites had grown the
  repo to ~291 MB; history was rewritten to purge them). QA commits `REPORT.md` /
  `OFFLINE.md` / `PWA-BASE.md` (text) only. Two curated shots for the README live in
  `docs/media/` — leave them alone. Humans view the app at the live PWA
  (jondridev.github.io/empire), not via committed screenshots.

## 🔒 DEPS SECURITY STATE (2026-07-06) — read before the weekly deps pass

- **`npm audit` = 5 vulns, ALL the vite/vitest/esbuild/launch-editor DEV-TOOLING chain** (dev-server-only, none ship in
  the built PWA). They are **deliberately deferred** — clearing them needs `vite` 5→8 + `vitest` 2→4 + `@vitejs/plugin-react`
  4→6 (a triple-major cascade). **Do NOT attempt unattended; leave for a human framework bump.** All 5 are documented in
  the `ALLOWLIST` of `scripts/check-audit.mjs` (GHSA url + reason each).
- **NEW GUARD `scripts/check-audit.mjs`** (in `verify.yml`): fails CI on any **NEW** high/critical advisory not on that
  allowlist → a genuinely new *shipped-dependency* CVE can't drift in green; the known dev-tooling ones stay accepted.
  When you clear a deferred vuln, **remove its allowlist entry** (the guard also prints stale entries to nudge this).
- **`epubjs` xmldom trap:** its `@xmldom/xmldom` is pinned to a patched `^0.8.13` via `overrides` in `package.json`.
  **Do NOT bump `epubjs` to 0.4.x** — that "fix" regresses to the ancient unscoped `xmldom@0.1.x` (older, still vulnerable)
  and is a breaking Reader major. Keep the override.

## ▶ Active epic & exact next-stage shape

> The single most important block. The Strategist keeps this in sync with the
> ACTIVE epic in [`docs/EPICS.md`](./EPICS.md). The Builder reads this and should
> be able to start editing **without re-planning**.

- **▶ NO ACTIVE EPIC STAGE (2026-07-06). EPIC-11 is DONE (code-complete + QA-confirmed). The Strategist must promote the
  next epic** — take the topmost cloud-executable ROADMAP candidate (EPIC-7 · Android stays device-gated). Builder runs are
  now shipping standalone POLISH increments while waiting; a real *epic* would let QA confirm a moved metric.
  - **↪ POLISH INCREMENT SHIPPED 2026-07-06 (this run, no active epic) — COMPLETED the empty-state unification: added a
    compact `size="sm"` variant to `<EmptyState>` + adopted the primitive on the 8 remaining hand-rolled empty states.
    Adoption 6 → 13 apps.** `EmptyState` (`src/components/ui/Utility.tsx`) gained `size?: 'md' | 'sm'` (default `'md'` →
    the 6 prior adopters byte-identical). `sm` re-tunes for narrow contexts: chip 56→40px (`--radius-xl`→`--radius-md`),
    padding `40/24`→`24/16`, gap 14→10, **minHeight 200→120px**, title `--text-base`→`--text-sm`, desc `--text-sm`→`--text-xs`
    (all tokens; spacing px not audited → offSystemStyle stays 0). **md adopters added (full-panel primaries the 07-05 run
    missed):** Goals, LearningTracker (both had a real icon'd collection-empty; dynamic filter-aware titles preserved).
    **sm adopters added (narrow sub-lists / player no-selection):** Music `No track playing`, Video `No video selected`,
    Maps saved-places, Browser bookmarks + history, Language phrase-book. `Utility.test.tsx` +2 (sm minHeight 120 / md 200).
    build🟢 vitest 365→367🟢 eslint clean (9 files); **offSystemStyle 0 (r0/t0/m0) ±0, tokens 0, off-system utils 0,
    `--assert-zero` exit 0**; bundle 717.4→717.6 (+0.2), no new deps.
    - **SEAM (reuse — the empty-state primitive is now fully general):** import `{ EmptyState }` from
      `../../components/ui/Utility`; `<EmptyState size="sm"? icon={<Glyph className="w-5 h-5"/> (sm) or "w-6 h-6" (md)}
      title=… description=… action?={…} accent?={var(--token)} />`. `size="sm"` = compact 120px block for sidebar
      sub-lists / player no-selection; default md = 200px full-panel block. Adoption count = `grep -rl EmptyState src/apps
      | wc -l` (now 13). Remaining hand-rolled empties are inline/italic one-liners (ColorPalette/FormBuilder/Clock/
      PromptGenerator/Cache) where a centred block is wrong by design — leave them.
    - **✅ QA-CONFIRMED LIVE (2026-07-06, green main `071a749`) — the size="sm" polish renders clean, no regression.**
      First headless render-QA of `071a749` (it landed mid-QA-run, after the last QA `97102af`; the rebase pulled it in so
      I reset to it and re-built + re-smoked the tree I'm actually pushing). All **30/30 routes render clean** (0 uncaught,
      0 console errors) incl. every touched app. **Visually confirmed the compact `size="sm"` empty state** (`app-music.png`:
      "No track playing · Add audio files to get started" + music-glyph tile, the compact 120px block) and clean renders of
      Language Lab / Maps / Browser / Video / Goals / LearningTracker. Every guard green (SHELL-IS-STYLED, REGISTRY-COVERAGE

      ▶ Still awaiting the Strategist to promote the next epic (EPIC-7 · Android device-gated).
  - **↪ POLISH INCREMENT SHIPPED 2026-07-05 (prior run, no active epic) — unified primary empty-states onto the shared
    `<EmptyState>` primitive; adoption 1 → 6 apps.** A crafted `EmptyState` (`src/components/ui/Utility.tsx`) existed but
    ONLY Notes used it — every other app hand-rolled a bare, inconsistent empty state. **Extended the primitive with an
    optional `accent?: string` prop** (a CSS colour *token* like `var(--c-pembaca)`; default path byte-identical so Notes is
    unaffected; the icon chip tints via `color-mix(in srgb, ${accent} 10/22%, transparent)` — token-only, metric-clean).
    **Converted the 5 primary full-panel collection-empty states:** Inbox (`var(--signal)`), Reader (`var(--c-pembaca)`,
    keeps its action btn + `className="flex-1"` for full-height centring), Photos (signal default), DataCenter
    (`var(--c-mesin)`, keeps action), Messages (signal default). New `Utility.test.tsx` (+5). build🟢 vitest 360→365🟢
    eslint clean; **offSystemStyle 0 (r0/t0/m0) ±0, tokens 0, off-system utils 0, `--assert-zero` exit 0**; bundle
    716.7→717.4 (+0.7), no new deps.
    - **✅ QA-CONFIRMED LIVE (2026-07-05, green main `6d983b3`) — the empty-state refactor renders clean, no regression.**
      First headless render-QA of `6d983b3` (it landed after the last QA `0b7af75`/`4c643a9`). All **30/30 routes render
      clean** incl. the 5 refactored apps (`datacenter`/`inbox`/`messages`/`photos`/`reader`, 0 uncaught, 0 console errors);
      **visually confirmed** the shared `<EmptyState>` primitive (`app-messages.png`: "No messages with Jondri yet · Start
      the conversation below." + send-glyph tile; `app-datacenter.png`: Tasks/Ideas tables clean). Every guard green
      (**PRECACHE 86 no-gap** — the refactor emitted +1 chunk), test cases 307/36 files, offSystemStyle **0 (r0/t0/m0)** ±0,
      bundle 717.4 ±0, `--assert-zero` exit 0 (also re-verified the LOCK trips: seeded `borderRadius:'7px'`→exit 1, revert→
      exit 0). **EPIC-11 stays CODE-COMPLETE + QA-confirmed; the refactor reintroduced no raw radii/type/easing.** ▶ Still
      awaiting the Strategist to promote the next epic (EPIC-7 · Android device-gated).
    - **SEAM (reuse — how to unify any empty state):** import `{ EmptyState }` from `../../components/ui/Utility`; render
      `<EmptyState icon={<Glyph className="w-6 h-6"/>} title=… description=… action={…} accent={APP_ACCENT} />`. `accent`
      is a `var(--*)` token (omit → signal/cyan default). It's a centred flex column, `minHeight:200px`, `padding:40px 24px`,
      token radii/type — add `className="flex-1"` when it must fill a flex-column parent (Reader). Adoption count =
      `grep -rl EmptyState src/apps | wc -l` (now 6).
    - **DELIBERATELY SKIPPED (a fit judgement, not a gap):** player "no-selection" states (Music `No track playing`, Video
      `No video selected`) and narrow sidebar sub-lists (Maps saved-places, Language phrase-book, Browser bookmarks/history)
      — the 200px block is oversized there. A future pass could add a compact `<EmptyState size="sm">` variant for them.
    - **jsdom TRAP (cost me a red test → fixed):** jsdom can't parse `color-mix()` and DROPS it when serialising inline
      style, so asserting the accent appears in `getAttribute('style')` FAILS. Don't test computed style for color-mix —
      assert render behaviour (icon/title present); the token-only guarantee is already carried by the grep-based metrics.
- **★ EPIC-11 (DONE) · Design-system conformance II (the non-colour token axis).**
  **S1–S4 ALL SHIPPED; `offSystemStyle` 56 → 0 (r0/t0/m0), LOCKED in `--assert-zero`.** **QA-CONFIRMED INDEPENDENTLY this run
  on green main `4c643a9`** — `metrics.mjs` reproduces `0 (r0/t0/m0)`, `--assert-zero` exits 0, build🟢 30/30 routes render
  clean, all guards green (see `docs/screenshots/latest/REPORT.md`). **The acceptance metric moved and holds → EPIC-11 is
  fully done, ready for the Strategist to retire to DONE.** **▶ THERE IS NO ACTIVE STAGE** — the next run promotes the next epic: take the
  topmost cloud-executable ROADMAP NOW/NEXT candidate and flag that EPICS.md needs the Strategist (EPIC-7 · Android stays
  device-gated). **Leap achieved:** EPIC-5 drove the two *colour* conformance metrics to 0; EPIC-11 did the same for the
  NON-colour token scales — **radii/type/easing** — all three sub-counts now 0 and gated.
  - **✅ S4 SHIPPED 2026-07-05 (`main`, this run) — MOTION m2→0 + LOCK. `offSystemStyle` 2 (r0/t0/m2) → 0 (r0/t0/m0), Δ-2.**
    Two raw easings tokenised: **`ArtifactGallery.tsx:229`** `.animate-fadeIn` `ease-out` → `var(--ease-out)` (clean swap, the
    keyword IS the token's intent); **`Calculator.tsx:428`** cyan pulse-dot `ease-in-out` → `var(--ease-in-out)`. `ease-in-out`
    is SYMMETRIC (neither `--ease-out` nor `--ease-spring` is equivalent) so — per the ratified spec — **DEFINED EXACTLY ONE new
    token `--ease-in-out: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` at `colors_and_type.css:106`** beside the other two easings, then swapped
    to it (a legit design-system extension). **LOCK:** `scripts/metrics.mjs:252` now has `if (snapshot.offSystemStyle > 0)
    fail.push(...)` in the `--assert-zero` gate (mirrors the tokenViolations/offSystemUtilities gates). **Verified by exit code
    both directions:** clean→exit 0; seed `borderRadius:'7px'`→`offSystemStyle 1 (r1)`, exit 1; remove→exit 0. build🟢 vitest
    360🟢 eslint clean; tokens 0, off-system-utils 0; bundle 718.9 ±0, no new deps.
    - **TRAP (audit scope — discovered this run):** `styleAudit.mjs`'s radii detector matches the property names `border-radius`
      / `borderRadius` ONLY — NOT the corner-specific `borderTopLeftRadius` etc. So to verify the lock trips, seed the canonical
      `borderRadius:'7px'` form (a `borderTopLeftRadius` seed will NOT be flagged and gives a false "lock broken" reading).
    - **KNOWN (held from the S4 plan):** the two ease tokens `--ease-out`(0.16,1,0.3,1) + `--ease-spring`(0.34,1.56,0.64,1) live
      at `colors_and_type.css:104-105`; `--ease-in-out`(0.4,0,0.2,1) is now the third at :106. The easing detector's
      `(?<![-\w])` lookbehind means `var(--ease-*)` refs are NOT flagged — so all three swaps read as clean.
  - **Prior progress (retained):** S1 audit+baseline (56); S2 type→0 (56→14); S3 radii→0 (14→2); S2+S3 QA-CONFIRMED LIVE
    2026-07-05 (`57262e8`). **Out-of-band: the Cakra Problem Solver (`solver` route) landed `57262e8` + QA-confirmed this run —
    see the S3-block note below.**
  - **✅ S1 SHIPPED 2026-07-04 (`main`, this run) — the audit + baseline stand up; `offSystemStyle` = 56 (r12/t42/m2).**
    New pure `scripts/styleAudit.mjs` `scanStyleViolations(text)→{radii,type,motion,total}` (radii = raw
    `border-radius`/`borderRadius` px/rem/em, `50%`/`9999px` excluded; type = raw `font-size`/`fontSize` px/rem/unitless-px,
    `em`/`%` allowed; motion = raw `cubic-bezier(`/`ease-in{,-out}`/`ease-out` — a `(?<![-\w])` lookbehind means
    `var(--ease-out)` refs are NOT flagged). 16 cases `styleAudit.test.mjs` (vitest picks up `scripts/**/*.test.mjs`).
    Wired into `metrics.mjs` `styleViolations()` via a newly-extracted shared `DS_INFRA`+`appCodeFiles()` helper (the two
    colour audits now call it too — DRY, behaviour-preserving, both still 0). New **Off-system style** table row +
    `offSystemStyle`/`offSystemStyleDims` snapshot + offenders print. Landed the one byte-identical fix (`--ease-out` ≡
    `cubic-bezier(0.16,1,0.3,1)`): `Toast.tsx` `cubic-bezier`→`var(--ease-out)`, m3→m2, 57→56. build🟢 vitest 318→334🟢
    (+16, +1 file) eslint clean; tokenViolations 0, offSystemUtilities 0, `--assert-zero` exit 0 (NOT locking the new
    metric while non-zero); bundle 705.4 ±0, no new deps.
    - **✅ QA-CONFIRMED LIVE (2026-07-04, green main `ad9c734`) — S1 done-confirmed, the audit + baseline reproduce
      independently.** First independent QA since EPIC-11 opened (last QA `698bbe2`/`ceddbef` = EPIC-10 S3 re-confirm;
      EPIC-10 retired + EPIC-11 S1 `ad9c734` landed since). S1's acceptance is *instrument + baseline*, not *move toward 0*:
      `node scripts/metrics.mjs` reproduces **Off-system style `56 (r12/t42/m2)`** EXACTLY on a fresh checkout, offenders
      reproduce (`Calculator.tsx` 13 · `ChartBuilder.tsx` 9 · `MarkdownStudio.tsx` 7 · `Notes.tsx`/`CommandPalette.tsx`/
      `ErrorBoundary.tsx` 5 · `Utility.tsx` 3 · `ChatPanel.tsx` 2), the +16 `styleAudit.test.mjs` cases run green (vitest
      **334/334**, 35 files), the two colour audits stay 0, `--assert-zero` exit 0. **29/29 routes render clean** (0
      uncaught JS); every guard green (SHELL-IS-STYLED, REGISTRY-COVERAGE 28, INBOUND 3/3, MEDIA 3/3, GRAPH-LEGIBLE 1/1,
      GLOBAL-SEARCH 1/1 `tagOnly`, NODE-LINEAGE 1/1 5-axes, **TIMELINE 1/1 all 6 axes**, HOME-ALIVE 1/1, PROVENANCE
      3/3+3/3, OFFLINE 5/5, PRECACHE 83 no-gap). Metrics reproduce the builder's S1 snapshot EXACTLY (apps 28, static 276,
      vitest 334, offSystemStyle 56, bundle 705.4, Δ ±0). **Visually confirmed** (`desktop.png` Bridge+28-grid,
      `app-timeline.png`). **No runtime bug, no contradiction.** *Note:* the metric has NOT moved toward 0 yet — S1 was
      audit-only; reduction starts at S2. **▶ EPIC-11 now RATIFIED by the Strategist 2026-07-04 (S2–S4 deepened with the
      authoritative per-file audit) → Builder takes S2.**
  - **✅ S2 SHIPPED 2026-07-04 (`main`, this run) — TYPE driven to 0. `offSystemStyle` 56 → 14 (`r12/t42/m2` → `r12/t0/m2`,
    Δ-42).** All 13 files' raw `font-size`/`fontSize` mapped onto `--text-*` by nearest step via a one-shot deterministic
    transform (validate-all-then-write; `scratchpad/type-fix.mjs`, not committed). Radii (r12) + motion (m2) held EXACTLY —
    the dim-major ordering kept the move crisp. **Mapping rule baked in:** nearest step; on an exact tie (even-px raw between
    two odd-px tokens) round UP to the larger token — `12px→sm(13)`, `14→base(15)`, `22→2xl(24)`. CSS-string / injected-HTML
    (`ChatPanel` code span) / SVG `<text>` (`ChartBuilder` × the 3 chart types) sites all take `var(--text-*)` fine — custom
    props cascade from `:root`. `MarkdownStudio 0.85em` correctly left (relative em, not counted). build🟢 vitest 334🟢
    eslint clean (all 13); `--assert-zero` exit 0 (colour metrics 0/0 untouched); bundle 705.4 ±0, no new deps.
    - **On-device confirm (>1.5px shift — cloud can't verify pixels):** `Calculator 32px→3xl(30)` −2, `ChartBuilder 22→2xl(24)`
      +2 (×3 SVG labels), `ErrorBoundary 2.5rem/40px→4xl(36)` −4 (decorative ⚠️), `MarkdownStudio 2rem/32px→3xl(30)` −2, and
      every `9px→xs(11)` +2 (footnote/kbd micro-labels: Calculator, CommandPalette). All other shifts ≤1px.
    - **SEAM (reuse for S3/S4):** the transform pattern is `scanStyleViolations` (audit) drives the file list; a validate-all-
      then-write node script over exact `from→to` substrings with per-pattern expected-count asserts is the safe bulk-edit
      rail (repeated `fontSize: '10px'` etc. collapse via string split/join, no fragile per-line Edits). Re-run
      `node scripts/metrics.mjs` and watch the target sub-count fall while the others hold. `metrics.mjs` PERSISTS its snapshot
      to `docs/metrics.json` on every run (so a 2nd run shows Δ±0 — the −42 is vs the committed baseline); commit the updated
      `metrics.json`. `npm install` churns `package-lock.json` (drops optional-dep `libc` fields) — `git checkout` it before commit.
    - **⚠️ QA still owes independent confirmation:** the headless render-smoke (`scripts/qa-smoke.mjs`) needs `playwright`, which
      is NOT in `package.json` (installing it = a new dep, forbidden for the builder) → the smoke is the QA run's step, not the
      builder's. Runtime render risk is negligible (pure CSS-value substitutions + passing tsc), but QA should still run the
      full smoke on the new green main to confirm the touched apps (Calculator, ChartBuilder/MarkdownStudio artifacts,
      CommandPalette, Notes, ErrorBoundary, Utility, ChatPanel, ConfirmModal, Desktop, NodeActions, SendResultMenu) render clean.
  - **✅ S3 SHIPPED 2026-07-05 (`main`, this run) — RADII driven to 0. `offSystemStyle` 14 → 2 (`r12/t0/m2` → `r0/t0/m2`,
    Δ-12).** All 12 raw `border-radius`/`borderRadius` px across the 6 files mapped onto `--radius-*` by nearest step; type
    (t0) + motion (m2) held EXACTLY (dim-major ordering kept the move crisp). **Mapping baked in:** `sm=10` is the FLOOR of the
    scale (sm10/md16/lg22/xl30/2xl40), so EVERY value ≤13px → `sm` — the 4px/5px/8px/0.5rem sites all became `var(--radius-sm)`
    (a +2 to +6px roundness increase on small chips/kbd/inline-code — the largest visual shift this run); `1rem`(16px) → `md`
    exact (ErrorBoundary panel); asymmetric `0 Npx Npx 0` (Notes marker rail, MarkdownStudio blockquote) → `0 var(--radius-sm)
    var(--radius-sm) 0`. CSS-string (MarkdownStudio `.md-*` template) + injected-HTML (ChatPanel `<code>` string) sites take
    `var(--radius-*)` fine — custom props cascade. **Sites:** Calculator ×3 (5px×2 copy/ask btns L313/332, 4px L569),
    MarkdownStudio ×3 (4px inline-code, 8px pre, `0 8px 8px 0` blockquote), Notes ×2 (`0 3px 3px 0` marker, 4px tag),
    ErrorBoundary ×2 (1rem panel, 0.5rem btn), ChatPanel ×1 (4px code), Toast ×1 (4px close btn). build🟢 vitest 334🟢 eslint
    clean (all 6); `--assert-zero` exit 0 (colour metrics 0/0 untouched); bundle 705.4 ±0, no new deps.
    - **On-device confirm (>1.5px shift — cloud can't verify pixels):** every 4px/5px→sm(10) is +5/+6px, most visible on the
      Calculator copy/ask icon buttons (24×24, now noticeably rounder) + the inline-code/tag pills (Notes, MarkdownStudio,
      ChatPanel, Toast). 8px→sm(10) = +2px (MarkdownStudio pre + blockquote). ErrorBoundary 1rem→md is exact. If any single
      element reads over-rounded, that's a design-scale question for the Strategist (the scale has no <10px step), NOT a bug.
  - **✅ S2 + S3 QA-CONFIRMED LIVE (2026-07-05, green main `57262e8`) — the acceptance metric moved twice, both reproduced
    independently.** First QA since S1 (last QA `ca10d0a`); S2 `20bc957` + S3 `4f79ded` + the Cakra Problem Solver `57262e8`
    landed since. `node scripts/metrics.mjs` reproduces **`offSystemStyle 2 (r0/t0/m2)`** EXACTLY on a fresh checkout — type
    sub-count 0 (S2 t42→0) + radii sub-count 0 (S3 r12→0), the metric fell 56→14→2 as ratified; the 2 survivors are the S4
    motion offenders (`ArtifactGallery.tsx` `ease-out` · `Calculator.tsx` `ease-in-out`). All touched apps render clean in the
    smoke (**30/30 routes, 0 uncaught**; every guard green: SHELL-IS-STYLED, REGISTRY-COVERAGE 29, INBOUND 3/3, MEDIA 3/3,

    (hidden alias → `ai-chat` tab, `/app/solver` deep-links the standalone panel) — 32-problem world catalog + 4-stage
    analyze→decompose→solve→critique engine + auto-queue; problem/solution nodes self-mirror into the Core graph (Calendar-style,
    NOT central `sync.ts`). **QA-confirmed it renders clean** (`app-solver.png`: "Problem Solver · AI", `0 open · 0 solved ·
    today 0/100 AI calls`, Import world catalog (32), daily budget 100, Solve everything, green-puzzle empty state). apps 28→29,
    +3 solver test files (`engine`/`catalog`/`queue`), bundle +12.6 (lazy chunk, declared). It correctly does NOT show as its own
    launcher tile. *Note: `public/solver/feed.json` is owned by routine #8 'World Solver' (daily 14:00 UTC) — not a QA concern.*
  - **✅ EPIC-11 S4 SHIPPED 2026-07-05 (this run) — motion m2→0 + LOCK; EPIC-11 is CODE-COMPLETE.** Details in the S4 block at
    the TOP of this file. Summary: `ArtifactGallery.tsx:229` `ease-out`→`var(--ease-out)`; `Calculator.tsx:428` `ease-in-out`→
    `var(--ease-in-out)` (new symmetric token `cubic-bezier(0.4,0,0.2,1)` added at `colors_and_type.css:106`, now the THIRD ease
    token); `offSystemStyle` added to the `--assert-zero` gate (`metrics.mjs:252`), verified trips on a seeded `borderRadius:'7px'`
    and passes clean. `offSystemStyle` = 0 (r0/t0/m0), LOCKED. **▶ NEXT STAGE = none in an active epic** — promote the next epic
    (topmost cloud-executable ROADMAP NOW/NEXT candidate; flag EPICS needs the Strategist; EPIC-7 · Android stays device-gated).
  - **TRAP (conformance-II audit):** (1) `metrics.mjs` is dependency-free by contract — `styleAudit.mjs` is a local
    dependency-free ESM import, keep it so (no npm deps). (2) The easing lookbehind `(?<![-\w])` is load-bearing: without
    it every `var(--ease-out)` in app code (Goals/Notes/ProvenanceChip…) would false-positive as a raw ease. (3) The
    metric walks the SAME `appCodeFiles()` set as the colour audits — DS-infra CSS (design-system.css, index.css,
    reader.css, epub.ts…) legitimately DEFINES raw radii/type/easing and is allowlisted; don't "fix" values there. (4)
    Raw SPACING (padding/margin/gap px) is DELIBERATELY not counted (no bounded token target) — don't add it without a
    curated allowlist or the metric stops being driveable. (5) `offSystemStyle` is now GATED in `--assert-zero` (S4 locked it
    at 0) — any new raw radii/type/easing fails the build/QA gate; keep it at 0 (use `var(--radius-*/--text-*/--ease-*)`).
    (6) The radii detector matches `border-radius`/`borderRadius` property names only — NOT corner-specific
    `borderTopLeftRadius` etc.; use the canonical `borderRadius` form when seeding a lock-verification violation.
- **Prior active epic (DONE — retired 2026-07-04):** **EPIC-10 · The Timeline (the organism's lifestream — a TEMPORAL lens)** — promoted 2026-07-03
  (Strategist; EPIC-9 retired to DONE). **Leap:** the organism has three lenses over its one Core graph —
  **Network** (structural), **Search** (query), **Inbox** (tasks) — but **no TEMPORAL lens**, even though every
  `CoreNode` has stamped `meta.created`/`meta.updated` (`graph.ts:27,71`) and every `ProvEdge` stamps `at` all along.
  EPIC-10 is the missing 4th lens: one newest-first, day-grouped stream merging **every entity-birth + every app→app
  handoff** into the organism's history — each row navigable to its entity (`openEntity`), its ancestry inline
  (`<NodeLineage>`), and (S3) what it spawned (`childrenOf` — built in EPIC-9 S1, unit-pinned, STILL UNUSED).
  **Target metric:** a **`TIMELINE` guard** in `qa-smoke.mjs` (`0/1 → 1/1`) + `timeline.test.ts`. Full stage specs in
  `docs/EPICS.md` → EPIC-10.
  - **✅ S1 SHIPPED 2026-07-04 (`main`, this run) — the 4th lens stands up end-to-end, `TIMELINE 0/1 → 1/1`.** The
    temporal lens exists. New pure **`src/lib/core/timeline.ts`**: `TimelineEntry` (`{id;kind:'entity'|'flow';at;nodeId?;
    app;title;type?;toApp?;label?}`); `buildTimeline(nodes,edges,limit=200)` maps nodes→entity (`at:meta.created`, `id:
    n:<id>`) + edges→flow (`at:edge.at`, `id: e:<from>:<to>:<at>`, synthesized `title`), merges, sorts **strictly
    newest-first by `at` with an `id` DESC tie-break** (total+deterministic), caps; `dayKey(at)` = UTC `YYYY-MM-DD`
    zero-padded; `groupByDay(entries)` = ordered `TimelineDay[]` (days + entries both newest-first); `relativeDayLabel
    (day, now)` = pure, `now` passed in → Today/Yesterday/date. New **`src/apps/timeline/Timeline.tsx`** = 28th app / 4th
    lens (copies Search's reactive-lens idiom): `useGraph(s=>s.nodes)`+`useProvenance(s=>s.edges)` → `groupByDay(build
    Timeline())`; sticky day headers via `relativeDayLabel(day, Date.now())` (the ONLY `Date.now()` call — spine stays
    pure); **entity** row = app glyph-dot + title + `type` chip + `agoLabel` + `<NodeLineage>` + ⚡`<NodeActions>`, whole
    row a `<button>`→`openEntity`; **flow** row = `from→to` glyphs+names+label+age, `role="note"`, NOT a button. Alien
    **`Timeline`** glyph (vertical time-spine + 3 orbital nodes) in `glyphs.tsx` + barrel + `alienIcons`; registry 28th
    app (`icon:'Timeline'`, color `#8fb4d8`, `cakraEnabled:false`); wired into `appComponents`. New **`TIMELINE` guard**
    (qa-smoke.mjs, non-fatal) + `timeline` in smoke list + REPORT section: seeds 2 `task` nodes (distinct `meta.created`,
    apps notes/goals) + 1 `empire-provenance` edge → reload → `/app/timeline` → asserts `ordered`+`grouped`+`flow`+
    `persisted` (2nd reload). **`timeline.test.ts` 15 cases.** **Ran the full smoke LIVE: TIMELINE 1/1 ✅**
    (`ordered=true grouped=true flow=true persisted=true`), 29/29 render clean, GLOBAL-SEARCH/NODE-LINEAGE/HOME-ALIVE
    1/1, PROVENANCE 3/3, OFFLINE 5/5, PRECACHE no-gap. build🟢 vitest 292→307🟢 eslint clean; tokens 0, off-system 0
    (`--assert-zero` exit 0); apps 27→28, routes 29/29, test files 30→31, bundle 701.4→703.5 (+2.1, no new deps).
    Screenshot confirms VISUALLY (`app-timeline.png`): clock-glyph+signal header, "· 2 moments", a **TODAY** sticky day
    header, two entity rows (accent dot + title + `dataset` type chip + `now`) — the lens renders real organism data.
    - **✅ QA-CONFIRMED LIVE (2026-07-04, green main `3cfe846`) — S1 done-confirmed, the temporal lens is real.** First
      independent QA since S1 landed (last QA `5d45ce8` = EPIC-9 S3; EPIC-9 retired + EPIC-10 promoted + S1 `3cfe846`
      landed since). **The S1 acceptance axis reproduced independently: `TIMELINE 1/1 ✅`** (`ordered=true grouped=true
      flow=true persisted=true`) — reproduced without the builder's tree, survives a 2nd reload. **29/29 routes render
      clean** (desktop + 28 apps, 0 uncaught JS). vitest **307/307** (33 files), `metrics.mjs --assert-zero` exit 0.
      Metrics reproduce the builder's S1 snapshot EXACTLY (apps 28, static 265, vitest 307, test files 31/33, bundle 703.5,
      Δ ±0). Every other guard green (SHELL-IS-STYLED, REGISTRY-COVERAGE 28, INBOUND 3/3, MEDIA 3/3, GRAPH-LEGIBLE 1/1,
      GLOBAL-SEARCH 1/1 `tagOnly`, NODE-LINEAGE 1/1 5-axes, HOME-ALIVE 1/1, PROVENANCE-PERSISTS/ENTITY 3/3, OFFLINE 5/5,
      PRECACHE 82 no-gap). **Visually confirmed** (`app-timeline.png`, above). **No runtime bug, no contradiction.**
      **▶ NEXT = EPIC-10 S3** (S2 filter + roving keyboard nav SHIPPED 2026-07-04 — see S2 block below; S3 spec below).
    - **SEAM (reuse for S2/S3):** the pure spine is `buildTimeline`/`groupByDay`/`dayKey`/`relativeDayLabel` — all
      `(nodes,edges,…)→value`, unit-pinned. Entity rows carry `data-timeline-kind="entity"`; flow rows
      `data-timeline-kind="flow"`; day sections `data-timeline-day="<key>"`. Timeline mirrors Search's lens idiom exactly,
      so S2 (facets+roving nav) can copy `search.ts`'s `filterHits`/`hitFacets`/`toggleFacet` + Search's roving cursor
      verbatim. S3 mounts `<NodeDescendants>` (new, mirrors `<NodeLineage>`) surfacing the long-dormant `childrenOf`.
    - **TRAPs (confirmed live):** (1) `timeline.ts` stays PURE — `relativeDayLabel` takes `now`; only the component reads
      `Date.now()`. (2) The guard seeds `task` (graph-only survives `startCoreSync`'s boot prune; note/learning/message do
      NOT). (3) `dayKey` is UTC so tests/guard don't flake across the runner tz. (4) **In qa-smoke.mjs `PROV_KEY` is
      declared LATE (~line 643), after the TIMELINE guard — I inlined the literal `'empire-provenance'` in the TIMELINE
      block to avoid the const temporal-dead-zone ReferenceError.** (5) The tie-break is `id` DESCENDING — entries with
      equal `at` order by higher `id` first; the tests pin this so don't "fix" it to ascending.
  - **✅ S2 SHIPPED 2026-07-04 (`main`, this run) — the temporal lens gets faceted controls + keyboard nav, `TIMELINE 1/1`
    grew a live `filtered` axis.** Three pure helpers in **`timeline.ts`** mirroring `search.ts`: `TimelineFilter`
    (`{apps?;kinds?:('entity'|'flow')[];types?}`), `filterTimeline(entries,filter)` (AND-across-dims, OR-within; empty dims →
    returns input untouched, order preserved; a `types` filter matches entity entries only — flows carry no `type`),
    `timelineFacets(entries):{apps:Facet[];kinds:Facet[]}` (distinct values + counts busiest-first then value-asc, computed
    over the **UNFILTERED** stream). Reuses `Facet` (type-import from `./search`) + `toggleFacet` (runtime import from
    `search.ts`). **`Timeline.tsx`** now holds `appFilter`/`kindFilter`/`activeIndex`; the outer scroll container is the
    focus target (`tabIndex={0}` + `onKeyDown`, autofocused on mount — Timeline has NO search input to host the keydown);
    renders **Kind** + **App** chip rows between header and stream (Search's `chip()` idiom but **signal** tint not ion — one
    accent per view; `aria-pressed`; each chip carries `data-timeline-facet="<dim>:<value>"` for the guard); regroups the
    FILTERED stream; roves the flat filtered list `days.flatMap(d=>d.entries)` via ↑/↓ (clamp) + Enter (`openEntity` for an
    entity row, no-op for a flow) + `scrollIntoView({block:'nearest'})` off `[data-timeline-id]`; active row = `boxShadow:
    inset 0 0 0 1px var(--ion)` + always-on ⚡; `activeIndex` resets to 0 on `[appFilter,kindFilter]`. Both rows now carry
    `data-timeline-id={entry.id}`. Header subtitle appends `· N shown` when filtered; empty-after-filter state says "No
    moments match these filters · Clear a filter chip". Guard grew a **`filtered`** axis: click the `app:goals` chip → only
    the goals-owned newer entity renders, the notes entity + the notes→goals flow (flow app = fromApp = notes) both drop.
    `timeline.test.ts` 15→22 (+7). **Ran full smoke LIVE: TIMELINE 1/1 ✅** (`ordered=true grouped=true flow=true
    persisted=true filtered=true`), 29/29 routes clean (0 uncaught), every guard green (GLOBAL-SEARCH/NODE-LINEAGE/
    HOME-ALIVE/GRAPH-LEGIBLE 1/1, PROVENANCE 3/3+3/3, OFFLINE 5/5, PRECACHE 83 no-gap). build🟢 vitest 307→314🟢 eslint
    clean; tokens 0, off-system 0 (`--assert-zero` exit 0); static 265→272, bundle 703.5→704.8 (+1.3, no new deps).
    - **✅ QA-CONFIRMED LIVE (2026-07-04, green main `a89e87e`) — S2 done-confirmed, the temporal lens is now faceted.**
      First independent QA since S2 landed (last QA `cf62dab` = S1 confirm on `3cfe846`; S2 `a89e87e` landed since). **The
      S2 acceptance axis reproduced independently: `TIMELINE 1/1 ✅` grew a fifth axis `filtered=true`** (`ordered=true
      grouped=true flow=true persisted=true filtered=true`) — clicking the `app:goals` facet chip narrows to ONLY the
      goals-owned entity, dropping the notes entity + the notes→goals flow, reproduced without the builder's tree. **29/29
      routes render clean** (0 uncaught JS). vitest **314/314** (33 files), `metrics.mjs --assert-zero` exit 0. Metrics
      reproduce the builder's S2 snapshot EXACTLY (apps 28, static 272, vitest 314, test files 31/33, bundle 704.8, Δ ±0).
      Every other guard green (SHELL-IS-STYLED, REGISTRY-COVERAGE 28, INBOUND 3/3, MEDIA 3/3, GRAPH-LEGIBLE 1/1,
      GLOBAL-SEARCH 1/1 `tagOnly`, NODE-LINEAGE 1/1 5-axes, HOME-ALIVE 1/1, PROVENANCE-PERSISTS/ENTITY 3/3, OFFLINE 5/5,
      PRECACHE 83 no-gap). **Visually confirmed** (`app-timeline.png`, the day-grouped stream). **Cloud limit:** the Kind/App
      facet chip rows render low-contrast against the dark theme with a 2-moment corpus → not prominent in the static shot;
      the `filtered` guard axis carries the facet-narrow roundtrip headless + the roving cursor is unit-pinned. **No runtime
      bug, no contradiction. ▶ NEXT = EPIC-10 S3** (spec below).
    - **SEAM (reuse for S3):** the faceted idiom is now proven in Timeline exactly as in Search — `filterTimeline`/
      `timelineFacets`/`toggleFacet` + the `chip('dim',current,setDim,value,label,count,color?)` helper (adds
      `data-timeline-facet`); roving cursor = `flat = days.flatMap(d=>d.entries)` + `activeIndex` clamped + `scrollIntoView`
      off `[data-timeline-id]`. Facets derive from the **UNFILTERED** stream, render the **FILTERED** stream.
    - **TRAPs (S2, confirmed live):** (1) the flow entry's `app` is its **fromApp** (`buildTimeline` sets `app:edge.fromApp`)
      — so an App filter on the source app keeps the flow, on the target app drops it; the guard relies on this. (2)
      `kindFilter` is `string[]` state but `filterTimeline` wants `('entity'|'flow')[]` — cast at the call site. (3)
      Autofocusing the container needs `outline:none` or a focus ring paints the whole panel. (4) Chip tint uses
      `var(--signal)` (Timeline's accent), NOT Search's `--ion`; the active-row cursor stays `--ion` per the S2 spec.
  - **✅ S3 SHIPPED 2026-07-04 (`main`, this run) — every moment now shows what it SPAWNED; the long-dormant `childrenOf`
    walker is finally live. `TIMELINE 1/1` grew a `descendants` axis. ★ EPIC-10 is CODE-COMPLETE (S1–S3).** New
    **`src/components/ui/NodeDescendants.tsx`** mirrors `NodeLineage.tsx`'s `EntityToken` VERBATIM: reactive
    `useGraph(s=>s.nodes)` → `childrenOf(nodes, nodeId)` (EPIC-9 S1 walker, first surface), renders a "→ spawned" label +
    one navigable `role="button"` span per child (`.gp-lineage-hop`, `openEntity(child.meta.app, child.id)` on click/Enter,
    `stopPropagation`+`preventDefault` — valid nested in the Timeline row `<button>`), returns **null** when childless,
    `data-node-descendants="<nodeId>"` attr. `Timeline.tsx` EntityRow mounts it beside `<NodeLineage>` in the meta line
    (`Timeline.tsx:280` region) so a moment reads BOTH ways: `↖ ancestry` + `→ spawned`. `NodeDescendants.test.tsx` **+4**
    (renders each token; click/Enter → `activeWindowId`=child app + `focusedId`=child id; empty→null). Guard: linked the
    two S1 seeds (`qa-tl-newer.data.from='qa-tl-older'`) → older row surfaces `[data-node-descendants=qa-tl-older]` naming
    the newer child (new `descendants` axis, read on the UNFILTERED stream before the filter click). **Ran full smoke LIVE:
    TIMELINE 1/1 ✅** (`ordered=true grouped=true flow=true persisted=true filtered=true descendants=true`), 29/29 routes
    clean (0 uncaught), every guard green (NODE-LINEAGE/GLOBAL-SEARCH/HOME-ALIVE/GRAPH-LEGIBLE 1/1, PROVENANCE 3/3+3/3,
    OFFLINE, PRECACHE 83 no-gap). build🟢 vitest 314→318🟢 eslint clean; tokens 0, off-system 0 (`--assert-zero` exit 0);
    static 272→276, test files 32, bundle 704.8→705.3 (+0.5, no new deps).
    - **⚠️ TRAP (load-bearing — discovered + fixed this run):** the guard's `readTimelineTitles` read the WHOLE entity row's
      `innerText`. Once S3's seed links the two nodes, the newer row's `<NodeLineage>` embeds the OLDER title and the older
      row's `<NodeDescendants>` embeds the NEWER title → reading full innerText would cross-contaminate `ordered`/`filtered`
      (`findIndex(t => t.includes(TL_OLDER_TITLE))` would hit the newer row too). **Fix: added `data-timeline-title` to the
      entity-row title `<div>` and scoped `readTimelineTitles` to `[data-timeline-kind="entity"] [data-timeline-title]`** —
      isolates the title from the trail text. If you touch the seed or the row, keep this isolation.
    - **SEAM/TRAP (from EPIC-9 S3, held):** a navigable token nested in a clickable row MUST be `role="button"`
      (span-with-role, NOT `<button>`) + tabIndex + `openEntity` + `stopPropagation`/`preventDefault`. `childrenOf` returns
      newest-first live CoreNodes. Real window/focus navigation is observable headless only on the Bridge/home (`/`) shell,
      NOT the `/app/*` route — the guard asserts the token renders + names the right child; the state change is unit-pinned
      in `NodeDescendants.test.tsx`.
    - **✅ QA-CONFIRMED LIVE (2026-07-04, green main `6a1a0b2`) — S3 done-confirmed; ★ EPIC-10 is fully QA-confirmed (S1–S3).**
      First independent QA since S3 landed (last QA `b3703ce` = S2 confirm on `a89e87e`; S3 `6059284` + docs pass `6a1a0b2`
      landed since). **The S3 acceptance axis reproduced independently: `TIMELINE 1/1 ✅` grew a sixth axis `descendants=true`**
      (`ordered=true grouped=true flow=true persisted=true filtered=true descendants=true`) — the older seed's Timeline row
      surfaces `[data-node-descendants=qa-tl-older]` naming the newer child it spawned, reproduced without the builder's tree;
      the long-dormant `childrenOf` walker is finally live. **29/29 routes render clean** (0 uncaught JS). vitest **318/318**

    - **✅ RE-CONFIRMED (2026-07-04, 2nd QA — HEAD `698bbe2` = the prior QA commit; no product code landed since `6a1a0b2`).**
      Independent health re-run on the same green main: build🟢, **29/29 routes clean** (0 uncaught), **`TIMELINE 1/1` all six

      EPIC-10 → DONE and promote the next epic (EPICS.md still shows EPIC-10 ▶ ACTIVE).
  - **EPIC-10 is CODE-COMPLETE + FULLY QA-CONFIRMED (S1–S3) and RETIRED to DONE (2026-07-04).** The topmost ROADMAP
    candidate **design-system conformance II** has been Builder-opened as **EPIC-11** (see the ACTIVE block at the top
    of this file — audit + baseline LIVE, next stage = S2 reduce type). **EPIC-7 · Android stays device-gated.**
  - _(EPIC-9 detail retained below as working memory — it is DONE, S1–S3 all QA-confirmed LIVE, `NODE-LINEAGE 1/1`.)_
- **Prior active epic (DONE — retired 2026-07-03, FULLY QA-CONFIRMED):** **EPIC-9 · Node-level lineage (per-artifact ancestry) — ★ CODE-COMPLETE (S1–S3 all shipped
  2026-07-03).** S1 QA-CONFIRMED LIVE `fcfa06d`; S2 QA-CONFIRMED LIVE `f878844`; **S3 QA-CONFIRMED LIVE `0378d8e` (by QA
  run `5d45ce8`) — node-lineage is NAVIGABLE, `NODE-LINEAGE clickable=true` axis reproduced independently, vitest 292,
  28/28 clean.** **Leap achieved:** provenance is node→node — every derived artifact shows *exactly which entity it
  descended from*, and you can CLICK any ancestor hop to climb to it. **Target metric (all 5 axes met):** `NODE-LINEAGE`
  guard = **1/1, 5 axes** (rendered/title/persisted/search/**clickable**) + `nodeLineage.test.ts` + `NodeLineage.test.tsx`.
  **`childrenOf` (descendants walker) shipped here but UNUSED → EPIC-10 S3 finally surfaces it.**
  - **✅ S3 SHIPPED 2026-07-03 (`main`, this run) — each ancestry hop climbs to its source entity.** `EntityToken` in
    **`src/components/ui/NodeLineage.tsx:25`** is now a `role="button"` span (tabIndex 0, Enter/Space) calling
    `openEntity(node.meta.app, node.id)` (EPIC-8 rail, `windowStore.ts:126`) → opens the ancestor's owning app + sets
    `useFocus.focusedId`. `stopPropagation`+`preventDefault` on the hop keeps it valid INSIDE Search's outer `<button>`
    row (a span-with-role isn't interactive content → no invalid button-in-button; the trap is resolved). Token-only
    `.gp-lineage-hop` affordance in **`design-system.css`** (~line 665: ion hover `color-mix` tint + focus-visible ring,
    no raw hex). **`NodeLineage.test.tsx` (+4)** pins navigation deterministically (click/Enter → `useWindowStore.activeWindowId`
    = ancestor app + `useFocus.focusedId` = ancestor id). Guard grew a 5th axis **`clickable`**. **Ran the full smoke LIVE:
    NODE-LINEAGE 1/1 ✅** (`rendered=true title=true persisted=true search=true clickable=true`), 28/28 clean, GLOBAL-SEARCH
    1/1, PROVENANCE 3/3, OFFLINE 5/5, PRECACHE no-gap. build🟢 vitest 288→292🟢 eslint clean; tokens 0, off-system 0
    (`--assert-zero` exit 0); static 246→250, bundle 701.2→701.4 (+0.2, no new deps).
    - **TRAP / cloud limit (load-bearing):** the smoke drives Search via the `/app/search` **route**, where `AppShell`
      renders by URL param (NOT windowStore) — so `openEntity`'s window swap is NOT observable headless on that route. The
      `clickable` axis therefore asserts the hop renders as a live `[role="button"]` wired to the right parent + clicks it
      (must not throw); the actual window/focus state change is unit-pinned in `NodeLineage.test.tsx`. Real navigation is
      observable only in the Bridge/home (`/`) shell, which DOES render by windowStore (`AppHost.tsx:18`).
    - **SEAM (reuse):** to make ANY lineage-style token navigable, mirror `EntityToken` — `role="button"` + tabIndex +
      `openEntity(app, id)` + `stopPropagation`/`preventDefault` (so it works nested in a clickable row). `.gp-lineage-hop`
      is the shared hop affordance class. Optional future: a "lineage of X" mini-tree (`nodeLineageOf` ancestors +
      `childrenOf` descendants — both walkers built + unit-pinned; not needed to close S3, deferred).
  - **▶ NEXT STAGE = none in an active epic — EPIC-9 is CODE-COMPLETE.** The Strategist promotes the next epic. If you
    arrive with no `▶ ACTIVE` epic, take the topmost cloud-executable candidate and flag EPICS needs the Strategist
    (EPIC-7 Android is device-gated). QA to confirm EPIC-9 done on the new green main: on the Bridge/home (`/`) open Search,
    query a term, click a result's lineage hop → the ancestor's app opens focused on it (the smoke's `clickable` axis +
    `NodeLineage.test.tsx` carry the wiring + state-change headless; the visual climb is the on-device confirm).
  - **✅ S2 SHIPPED (2026-07-03, `main`) — node-lineage legible on the two graph-node-rendering views.** Dropped
    `<NodeLineage nodeId>` on: **(a)** the **Network inspector's per-entity list** (`Network.tsx` ~line 680) — REPLACED the
    bare type-count summary with a real entity list (newest-first, `ENTITY_ROWS=12` cap + "+ N more"), each row = type dot
    + title + its ancestry trail (self-hides when no `data.from`); removed the now-unused `selTypeCounts`. **(b)** **Search
    result rows** (`Search.tsx` ResultRow meta line, ~line 284) — lineage under the type/snippet, meta line made
    `flex-wrap`. Both reuse the S1 component + walker VERBATIM (no new logic). Extended the `NODE-LINEAGE` guard
    (`qa-smoke.mjs`) with a 4th axis `search`: after the Inbox check, open `/app/search`, query "anomaly", assert the
    child hit renders `[data-node-lineage=qa-lineage-parent]`. **Smoke LIVE: NODE-LINEAGE 1/1 ✅** (`rendered=true
    title=true persisted=true search=true`), 28/28 clean. build🟢 vitest 288🟢 eslint clean; tokens 0, off-system 0
    (`--assert-zero` exit 0); bundle gz 701.2 ±0. *Cloud limit:* the Network inspector list is a visual/on-device render
    (driving the canvas node-click headless is fragile) — the Search axis carries the mount roundtrip; the inspector reuses
    the same unit-pinned component.
    - **⚠️ TRAP / CORRECTION (load-bearing — do NOT try Notes/Learning cards again):** the original S2 spec said "drop it
      on Notes cards (make-note-from) + Learning items (add-to-learning)". **This is architecturally impossible** and was
      the run's key discovery. The intents (`sync.ts:139-159`) create standalone GRAPH nodes with `data.from`, NOT local
      Notes/Learning store items; those `note`/`learning` graph nodes get PRUNED by the central reconcile (`sync.ts:64`,
      keyed on `data.sourceId` which they lack) on the next store tick. The Notes/Learning apps render ONLY local `useStore`
      items whose mirror mapping DROPS `from` (`sync.ts:80-91` map content/tags / learned/mastered only) → a local
      note/learning item NEVER carries `data.from` → `<NodeLineage>` there is always null. The derived nodes that DO carry
      durable `data.from` are **make-task tasks** (graph-only → not pruned, owned by their source app) → they surface in
      Inbox (S1), the Network inspector, and Search (S2) — which is exactly where lineage now renders.
  - **↪ OFF-EPIC LANDING (user-directed) — `436cebf` The Bridge · living home screen.** The desktop root (`/`) is now
    **`src/components/Bridge.tsx`** (+ `Recents.tsx`, `AppHost.tsx`; `Window.tsx` deleted): a greeting header, an "Ask
    Cakra anything…" bar, four live stat cards (TODAY / OPEN TASKS / GOALS / ORGANISM), and the app-launcher grid. Guarded
    by a new **`HOME-ALIVE`** assertion in `qa-smoke.mjs` (`today/tasks/recent/land/ask` all present). **QA-CONFIRMED LIVE
    2026-07-03 on `436cebf`: `HOME-ALIVE 1/1 ✅`, renders clean (`desktop.png`), 28/28 routes green, vitest 288, no
    regression.** Not an epic stage — EPIC-9 remains ACTIVE.
  - **✅ S1 SHIPPED + VERIFIED LIVE (2026-07-03, `main`) — per-artifact ancestry is legible + queryable.** The data
    already existed: the three core intents (`make-task`/`make-note-from`/`add-to-learning`, `sync.ts:120-159`) stamp
    **`data.from = sourceNode.id`** on every node they create AND `link()` the pair, so `empire-core-graph` already
    held a durable per-artifact ancestry edge — what was missing was a *reader*. New pure **`src/lib/core/nodeLineage.ts`**:
    `parentIdOf(node)` (`typeof data.from === 'string'`), `nodeLineageOf(nodes, id, maxDepth=6)` (walk `data.from`
    backwards → live CoreNode chain `[node, parent, …]`, cycle-guarded, STOPS at a missing/foreign parent id, returns
    `[]` if node absent), `childrenOf(nodes, id)` (descendants, newest-first). `nodeLineage.test.ts` **11 cases**. New
    **`src/components/ui/NodeLineage.tsx`** = `<NodeLineage nodeId />`: reactive `useGraph(s=>s.nodes)`, walks
    `nodeLineageOf`, renders the ANCESTOR chain (`chain.slice(1)`) as real entity titles + owning-app registry
    accent/glyph, `↖`/`←` separators, `role="note"` + **`data-node-lineage="<parentId>"`** attr + aria-label; returns
    **null** when no resolvable ancestor. Token-only (mirrors `LineageTrail`: `app.color` is registry identity, no raw
    hex). Wired into **`Inbox.tsx` `TaskRow`** beside the source-app chip (meta line refactored to a flex-wrap row).
    New **`NODE-LINEAGE` guard** in `qa-smoke.mjs` (after GLOBAL-SEARCH): seeds two graph-survivable `task` nodes
    (parent + child with `data.from`=parent), loads `/app/inbox`, reload, asserts a `[data-node-lineage=parent]` el +
    the parent title, reload AGAIN → still resolves. **Ran the full smoke LIVE: NODE-LINEAGE 1/1 ✅** (`rendered=true
    title=true persisted=true`), **28/28 routes render clean**, every other guard green. build🟢 vitest 265→276🟢
    eslint clean; tokens 0, off-system 0 (`--assert-zero` exit 0); apps 27, static 223→234, bundle 697.5→698.1
    (+0.6, no new deps).
    - **✅ QA-CONFIRMED LIVE (2026-07-03, green main `fcfa06d`) — S1 done-confirmed, per-artifact ancestry is legible.**
      First independent QA since S1 landed (last QA `7ef9a5c` confirmed EPIC-8 S2 on `1db665e`; EPIC-8 S3 `4e6a78a` +
      EPIC-9 S1 `fcfa06d` landed since). **28/28 routes render clean** (desktop + 27 apps, 0 uncaught JS). **The S1
      acceptance axis reproduced independently: `NODE-LINEAGE 1/1 ✅`** (`rendered=true title=true persisted=true`) — a
      child `task` whose `data.from`=a parent id surfaces a `[data-node-lineage=<parentId>]` el carrying the parent's
      REAL entity title on `/app/inbox`, and it STILL resolves after TWO reloads (durable `empire-core-graph`). **Also
      confirmed VISUALLY** (`s1-node-lineage-inbox.png`): the "Draft Q3 roadmap" Inbox row renders the NodeLineage trail
      `↖ ⌾ Quarterly planning source` (real ancestor entity, not an app name). vitest **276/276** (+11 `nodeLineage.test.ts`),
      eslint 0, `metrics.mjs --assert-zero` exit 0 (tokens 0, off-system 0). Every other guard green (SHELL-IS-STYLED,
      REGISTRY-COVERAGE 27, INBOUND 3/3, MEDIA 3/3, GRAPH-LEGIBLE 1/1, GLOBAL-SEARCH 1/1 `tagOnly=true`, PROVENANCE-PERSISTS
      3/3, PROVENANCE-ENTITY 3/3, OFFLINE-BOOT 5/5, PRECACHE 80 no-gap). Metrics reproduce the builder's S1 snapshot exactly
      (apps 27, static 234, vitest 276, bundle 698.1, Δ ±0). **No runtime bug, no contradiction. EPIC-8 (S1–S3) stays
      CODE-COMPLETE — GLOBAL-SEARCH 1/1 held, so S3 didn't regress the corpus.** **▶ NEXT = EPIC-9 S2** (mount
      `<NodeLineage>` on Notes/Learning/Network — reuse verbatim); Strategist still owes S2–S3 ratification.
    - **SEAM for S2/S3 (reuse, do NOT reinvent):** `nodeLineageOf`/`childrenOf` are the walkers; `<NodeLineage nodeId>`
      is the drop-in surface. To show ancestry anywhere a derived entity renders, just mount `<NodeLineage nodeId>` —
      it reads the graph reactively and self-hides when there's no `data.from`. **▶ NEXT STAGE = EPIC-9 S2:** drop it
      onto **Notes** cards (`make-note-from` → `data.from`), **Learning** items (`add-to-learning`), and the **Network
      inspector**'s per-entity list. Reuse verbatim; extend the `NODE-LINEAGE` guard with a Notes seed.
    - **TRAP (same as GLOBAL-SEARCH):** the guard MUST seed graph-survivable types — `startCoreSync()` prunes
      centrally-mirrored types (note/learning/message) absent from their (empty, fresh-QA) stores. `task` is graph-only
      → survives the boot reconcile. A `note`-typed seed on `/app/inbox` would be DELETED before render.
    - **TRAP:** `parentIdOf` guards `typeof from === 'string'` — some nodes could carry `data.from` as a non-string
      flag, so a bare truthiness check would false-positive. Keep the string + non-empty guard.
  - _(EPIC-8 history retained below as working memory — it is CODE-COMPLETE, S1–S2 QA-confirmed, S3 shipped/QA-pending.)_
- **Prior active epic (CODE-COMPLETE):** **▶ EPIC-8 · Global cross-app search (the organism becomes queryable)** — promoted 2026-07-02
  (EPIC-6 CLOSED & QA-confirmed on `e262f1b`; no active epic remained; EPIC-7 Android stays device-gated). **Leap:**
  one Search surface queries EVERY app's real entities at once (the Core graph already mirrors them all) — ranked,
  grouped by owning app, one click from each entity's home. **Target metric:** a `GLOBAL-SEARCH` guard in
  `qa-smoke.mjs` (`0/1 → 1/1`) + `search.test.ts`. Full stage specs in `docs/EPICS.md` → EPIC-8.
  - **✅ S1 SHIPPED + VERIFIED LIVE (2026-07-02) — the queryable organism exists end-to-end.** Pure spine
    **`src/lib/core/search.ts`** (`searchNodes(nodes,query,limit=50)` / `scoreNode` / `nodeBodyText` / `queryTerms` /
    `groupHitsByApp` — AND semantics, title-prefix≫substring≫type≫body, recency tie-break; `search.test.ts` 13 cases).
    New **`src/apps/search/Search.tsx`** = the 27th app (registry `search` accent `#5b8fb9`/ion, `appComponents`, new
    alien `Search` glyph in `icons/glyphs.tsx` + barrel): reactive `useGraph(s=>s.nodes)`, autofocused field, idle/empty/
    no-match states, results grouped by `groupHitsByApp` into `<section data-search-group={app}>` (registry glyph+accent
    header), each row → `openAppById(app)` + ⚡ `<NodeActions nodeId>`. New **`GLOBAL-SEARCH` guard** in `qa-smoke.mjs`
    (+ `search` in the smoke list + REPORT section) — **ran LIVE this run 1/1 ✅** (`book=true task=true twoApps=true`,
    groups reader,goals). build🟢 vitest 242→255🟢 eslint 0; tokens 0, off-system 0 (`--assert-zero` exit 0); apps 26→27,
    bundle 693.6→696.0 (+2.4, no new deps). 28/28 routes render clean, every other guard green.
    - **✅ QA-CONFIRMED LIVE (2026-07-02, green main `ac6af7b`) — S1 done-confirmed, the organism is queryable.**
      First independent QA after S1 landed (last QA was `5b8163c` = EPIC-6 S4). Ran the full headless smoke end-to-end:
      **28/28 routes render clean** (desktop + 27 apps, 0 uncaught JS), incl. the new **Search** app (`app-search.png`).
      **`GLOBAL-SEARCH 1/1 ✅`** reproduced independently (`book=true task=true twoApps=true`, groups reader,goals) →
      **EPIC-8 S1 target metric MOVED `0/1 → 1/1`, S1 done-confirmed, no contradiction.** vitest **255/255**, eslint 0,
      `metrics.mjs --assert-zero` exit 0 (tokens 0, off-system 0), all other guards green (INBOUND 3/3, MEDIA 3/3,
      GRAPH-LEGIBLE 1/1, PROVENANCE-PERSISTS 3/3, PROVENANCE-ENTITY 3/3, OFFLINE-BOOT 5/5, PRECACHE 80 no-gap). Metrics
      reproduce the builder's snapshot exactly (apps 27, tests 213 static/255 vitest, bundle 696, Δ ±0 vs the metrics.json
      the builder committed with S1). **No runtime bug.** *Cloud limit:* the seed corpus is graph-only (see TRAP below), so
      the visual of real cross-app hits is on-device; the guard carries the roundtrip headless.
    - **TRAP (learned + baked into the guard):** `startCoreSync()` (sync.ts) reconciles the CENTRALLY-mirrored types
      **note/learning/message** against the global store on boot and PRUNES any such node absent from that store. So a
      QA seed of a `note` on `/app/search` (empty Notes store) is DELETED before search runs — the guard seeds
      graph-survivable types instead (`task` graph-only; `book` self-mirrored by an unmounted Reader). In real usage
      those types come from real non-empty stores → the feature searches them fine.
    - **✅ S2 SHIPPED 2026-07-03 (`main`) — hits land on their exact entity + tags are searchable.** Both gaps closed:
      **(a)** `nodeBodyText` (`search.ts:43`, via a new `pushScalar` helper) now flattens the scalar elements of ARRAY
      values (nested objects still skipped) → `notes.data.tags` / `calendar.data.tags` / `photos.data.tags` are
      searchable. **(b)** new **`openEntity(appId, nodeId)`** in **`windowStore.ts:119`** = `openAppById(appId)` then
      `useFocus.getState().setFocus(nodeId)` (imports `useFocus` from `core/focus.ts`); both `Search.tsx` result-row
      buttons now call `openEntity(appId, node.id)` (was `openAppById`). **Notes lands on the focused card**
      (`Notes.tsx`): reads `useFocus(s=>s.focusedId)`, looks up `useGraph.getState().nodes[focusedId]`, maps to its note
      via `gnode.data.sourceId`, `el.scrollIntoView({block:'center'})` + a one-shot `.focus-land` class (a token-only
      signal ring, `@keyframes focus-land-ring` in **`design-system.css:656`**, no raw hex). A `handledFocus` ref
      guards against re-ringing on unrelated graph ticks; deps `[focusedId, notes]` so it retries once the card mounts.
      `GLOBAL-SEARCH` guard grew a **third seed** (`Tessellate` in `data.tags` of a graph-survivable task) — **ran LIVE
      `tagOnly=true`, GLOBAL-SEARCH 1/1 ✅, 28/28 clean.** vitest 255→257, tokens 0, off-system 0, bundle 696.0→696.4.
      - **✅ QA-CONFIRMED LIVE (2026-07-03, green main `1db665e`) — S2 done-confirmed, tags/arrays now searchable.**
        First independent QA since S2 landed (last QA `ce30e4e` confirmed S1 on `ac6af7b`; S2 `1db665e` + the strategy
        doc `88e2689` landed since). **28/28 routes render clean** (desktop + 27 apps, 0 uncaught JS). **The S2 acceptance
        axis reproduced independently: `GLOBAL-SEARCH` guard `tagOnly=true`** — a node carrying `Tessellate` ONLY in
        `data.tags` (a string array) surfaces, proving `nodeBodyText`'s array-flatten (`book=true task=true twoApps=true
        tagOnly=true`, groups reader,goals → 1/1 ✅). vitest **257/257** (+2 array-flatten + tag-only cases), eslint 0,
        `metrics.mjs --assert-zero` exit 0 (tokens 0, off-system 0). Every other guard green (SHELL-IS-STYLED,
        REGISTRY-COVERAGE 27, INBOUND 3/3, MEDIA 3/3, GRAPH-LEGIBLE 1/1, PROVENANCE-PERSISTS 3/3, PROVENANCE-ENTITY 3/3,

        (+0.4, no new deps); tokens/off-system ±0. **No runtime bug, no contradiction.** *Cloud limit:* `openEntity` +
        Notes `.focus-land` ring is an on-device visual (fresh-checkout corpus is graph-only, see the TRAP above) —
        unit-pinned; the guard carries the tag/array roundtrip headless. **S2 done-confirmed → only S3 remains to CLOSE EPIC-8.**
      - **SEAM for S3 / any deep-link:** `openEntity(appId, nodeId)` is the rail — open + gaze. To land another app on
        its focused item, copy the Notes pattern: `useFocus(s=>s.focusedId)` → `useGraph.getState().nodes[id]` →
        `node.data.sourceId` → your local item → scroll + `.focus-land`. TRAP: read the graph via `getState()` (NOT a
        reactive `useGraph` sub) inside the effect, or every mirror tick re-fires the scroll; gate with a `handledFocus`
        ref keyed on the focusedId you already handled.
    - **✅ S3 SHIPPED 2026-07-03 (`main`) — filters + keyboard nav + summon → EPIC-8 CODE-COMPLETE.** Three parts:
      **(a)** three new pure helpers in **`search.ts`** (after `groupHitsByApp`): `filterHits(hits,{types?,apps?})`
      (AND-across-dims, OR-within; empty dims → returns input untouched, order preserved), `hitFacets(hits)` →
      `{types:Facet[], apps:Facet[]}` (distinct values w/ counts, busiest-first then value-asc — computed over
      UNFILTERED hits so chips always widen back), `toggleFacet(list,v)` (add/remove). `Search.tsx` holds `typeFilter`/
      `appFilter` state, renders Type + App chip rows (`chip()` helper, ion tint when on, `aria-pressed`) between the
      field and results, filters the rendered hits via `filterHits`. **(b)** `activeIndex` state roves the FLAT list
      `groups.flatMap(g=>g.hits)` (same order groups render); `onKeyDown` on the input handles ↑/↓ (clamp) + Enter →
      `openEntity(hit.node.meta.app, hit.node.id)`; an effect `scrollIntoView({block:'nearest'})` via a
      `[data-result-id]` selector; active row = `boxShadow: inset 0 0 0 1px var(--ion)` + always-on ⚡ actions;
      `activeIndex` resets to 0 on `[query,typeFilter,appFilter]`. **(c)** THIRD distinct shell key **⌘/Ctrl+Shift+F**
      in **`Desktop.tsx`** keydown (beside Ctrl+Space): `openAppById('search')` + `dispatchEvent(new
      CustomEvent('empire:summon-search'))`; `Search.tsx` has a `window.addEventListener('empire:summon-search')`
      effect that `focus()`+`select()`s the field (mount autofocus covers first-open, so both open-paths refocus).
      `search.test.ts` +8. build🟢 vitest 257→265🟢 eslint . clean; tokens 0, off-system 0 (`--assert-zero` exit 0);
      static 215→223, bundle 696.4→697.5 (+1.1, no new deps). **Ran the full smoke LIVE: 28/28 render clean incl.
      search, GLOBAL-SEARCH 1/1 ✅ (unchanged — S3 didn't regress the corpus/deep-link).**
      - **SEAM for keyboard-nav / faceted-search reuse:** the roving cursor pattern is `flat = groups.flatMap(g=>g.hits)`
        + `activeIndex` clamped + `scrollIntoView({block:'nearest'})` off a `[data-result-id]` attr; DON'T index into the
        grouped structure directly — flatten in render order so the visual cursor matches. Filter chips = derive facets
        from the UNFILTERED hit set (`hitFacets`), render the FILTERED set (`filterHits`) — never facet the filtered set
        or you can't widen back. Global summon that must refocus an already-open app = openAppById + a window CustomEvent
        the app listens for (a mount effect alone won't refire when the app is already foregrounded).
    - **▶ NEXT BUILDER STAGE = none in an active epic — EPIC-8 is CODE-COMPLETE (S1–S3 all shipped on `main`).** The
      Strategist should promote the next epic. Topmost cloud-executable candidate = **node-level lineage** (correlate a
      `HANDOFF` with the specific entity it created — per-artifact ancestry; `lineageOf` in `provenance.ts` is the rail;
      the durable `empire-provenance` edge store + `openEntity`/`focusedId` deep-link are both built). **EPIC-7 · Android
      stays device-gated** (not cloud-verifiable). If you arrive with no `▶ ACTIVE` epic promoted, take node-level
      lineage and flag EPICS needs the Strategist. **QA to confirm EPIC-8 done on the new green main:** type a term
      matching ≥2 apps → grouped hits; click a Type chip → only that type; ↑/↓/Enter opens a hit mouse-free; ⌘⇧F from any
      app opens Search with the field focused (the smoke's GLOBAL-SEARCH 1/1 carries the corpus roundtrip headless).
  - _(EPIC-6 history retained below as working memory.)_
- **Prior active epic (DONE):** **EPIC-6 · Organism Memory (durable provenance & lineage)** — promoted 2026-07-01,
  CLOSED 2026-07-02 (all S1–S4 shipped + QA-confirmed). **Leap:** the organism stops fires-and-forgetting — a
  durable `empire-provenance` store records every real app→app transfer, The Network *remembers* (persistent memory
  panel + all-time "fed by/feeds"), each entity's source survives a reload, and Reader's books (the last graph-island)
  become legible. **Target metric:** a new `PROVENANCE-PERSISTS 0/3 → 3/3` guard in `qa-smoke.mjs` (seed handoff →
  reload → durable source still shows) + Reader graph-legible. Full stage specs in `docs/EPICS.md` → EPIC-6.
  - **✅ S1 SHIPPED (2026-07-02) — the memory spine is laid.** `src/lib/core/provenance.ts` exists:
    `ProvEdge{fromApp,toApp,label?,at}`, Zustand+persist `useProvenance` (key `empire-provenance`, `record`/`clear`),
    exported pure `MAX_EDGES=500`/`DEDUP_MS=1500`, `recordEdges(edges,edge,now)` (coalesce-then-cap),
    `edgesInto`/`edgesFrom` (newest-first filters), `lineageOf(edges,appId,maxDepth=6)` (newest-inbound walk,
    cycle-guarded). `startProvenanceTracking()` wired once at **`main.tsx:20`** (after `startFocusTracking()`). Edge
    source is `flowForEvent` ONLY. `provenance.test.ts` 14 cases. build🟢 vitest 230🟢 eslint clean; tokens 0,
    off-system 0, bundle 691.8. **Coalesce note:** `record` passes `edge.at` as `now`, so a repeat same-pair edge
    within 1500 ms of the prior one bumps its `at` (and refreshes `label` if the new one supplies it).
    - **✅ QA-CONFIRMED LIVE (2026-07-02, green main `23860d5`) — S1 done-confirmed, the memory spine persists.**
      First QA after EPIC-6 S1 landed (last QA was `b54461e`; S1 `23860d5` + its promotion `6b6c693` landed since).
      27/27 render clean (0 uncaught JS), vitest **230/230** (+14 `provenance.test.ts`), eslint 0, `--assert-zero`
      exit 0. **Added a NEW `PROVENANCE-PERSISTS` guard to `qa-smoke.mjs`** (the EPIC-6 target-metric harness): fires
      3 REAL handoffs from the **Editor's ⚡ Send menu** (`editor→notes` via NOTE_CREATED-from-editor, `editor→ai-chat`
      + `editor→prompt-generator` via HANDOFF) → asserts each edge is recorded in `empire-provenance` AND **survives a
      full reload** — the tracker→persist→rehydrate roundtrip jsdom can't do. **3/3 ✅.** The guard is non-fatal
      (recorded, not thrown) like INBOUND/MEDIA. **Reuse pattern for S2/S3 acceptance:** fill the Editor textarea →
      click `button[aria-label="Send code to…"]` → click `button[role="menuitem"]` by label; read edges via
      `JSON.parse(localStorage['empire-provenance']).state.edges`. **S2 NOT built** — The Network still shows the live
      "awaiting signal" ticker (no durable Fed-by/Feeds or memory panel yet). Metrics all ±0 except vitest +14 &
      bundle 691.4→691.8 (+0.4, the store module, no new deps). No runtime bug, no contradiction.
  - **✅ S2 SHIPPED (2026-07-02) — The Network remembers.** `Network.tsx` now subscribes `const provEdges =
    useProvenance(s => s.edges)` reactively (**`Network.tsx:~142`**, beside the `graphNodes` sub). Two surfaces:
    (1) **Inspector `Provenance · all-time` section** (rendered between "Connected apps" and the Open button): **Fed
    by** = `fedBy(provEdges, selected.id)`, **Feeds** = `feeds(provEdges, selected.id)` — each a clickable `provRow`
    (glyph `←`/`→` + app glyph+`${app.color}` + name + `ago(newest at)` → `openById`). `provRow`/`rowStyle` are
    defined *inside the inspector IIFE*. (2) **Persistent Memory panel** in the bottom-left: I **refactored the
    ticker into a column container** (`position:absolute; left:16; bottom:16`) holding the Memory panel (top) over
    the live ticker (bottom, at the corner). Memory lists `recentEdges(provEdges, MEMORY_ROWS=12)` newest-first as
    `from-glyph name → to-glyph name age` rows, plasma pulse-dot header, `maxHeight:34vh; overflowY:auto;
    pointerEvents:auto` (scrollable). Reads the store → survives reload; ticker stays session-only.
    - **New pure helpers in `provenance.ts`** (unit-pinned, reused by both panels): `ProvNeighbor{app,at,label?}`;
      `fedBy(edges,appId)`/`feeds(edges,appId)` = `uniqueNeighbours(edgesInto/From, pick)` (de-dupe first-wins over
      the already newest-first list → newest edge per app); `recentEdges(edges,n=12)` = `slice(-n).reverse()`. +6
      cases in `provenance.test.ts`. **Reuse for S3:** `lineageOf` is the same store; `LineageTrail` can read it.
    - **Colour rail respected:** `cssVar('plasma')` (memory header dot), `tint('signal',10)` (row hover), registry
      `${app.color}` for glyph tint (DS_INFRA-exempt). tokens 0, off-system 0, `--assert-zero` exit 0. build🟢
      vitest 236🟢 eslint clean (full `npx eslint .` exit 0); bundle 691.8→692.5 (+0.7, UI+helpers, no new deps).
    - *Cloud limit:* the two panels are a **visual render** (QA screenshots) — the pure selection is unit-pinned;
      I could not see them. **QA to confirm:** seed handoffs (Editor ⚡ Send menu, per S1 guard) → open The Network →
      click a node → inspector shows Fed by/Feeds; the bottom-left Memory panel lists `source → target` rows;
      **reload → Memory persists, Live ticker empty.**
    - **✅ QA-CONFIRMED LIVE (2026-07-02, green main `f5ab6be`) — S2 done-confirmed, The Network visibly remembers.**
      First QA since S2 landed (`f5ab6be`; last QA `312033c` was the S1 confirm). 27/27 render clean (0 uncaught JS),
      vitest **236/236** (+6 `fedBy`/`feeds`/`recentEdges`), eslint 0, `--assert-zero` exit 0, all guards green
      (SHELL-IS-STYLED, REGISTRY-COVERAGE, INBOUND 3/3, MEDIA 3/3, **PROVENANCE-PERSISTS 3/3**, OFFLINE 5/5, PRECACHE
      78 no-gap). **Confirmed the headline Memory-panel surface directly** (`network-memory{,-after-reload}.png`):
      seeded 5 durable `empire-provenance` edges → the bottom-left Memory panel renders them **newest-first** as
      `source → target` rows (registry glyphs+accents + `ago`), over an empty "awaiting signal…" ticker; **reload →
      Memory panel still shows all 5** (newest row's age ticked `21s→24s` = SAME durable data re-read, not a fresh
      session) while the Live ticker stays empty (session-only). Durable ledger `edges=5` after reload. **The inspector
      Fed-by/Feeds section was NOT captured headless** (it needs a clicked satellite node = a real core-graph node;
      seeding the graph deterministically is fragile) — the helpers are unit-pinned (+6) and the Memory panel proves
      the same durable store reads+renders. Metrics: static 188→194 (+6), vitest 230→236 (+6), bundle 691.8→692.5
      (+0.7, S2 UI+helpers, no new deps); apps/tokens/off-system ±0. No runtime bug, no contradiction.
      **Reuse for S3 visual acceptance:** the Memory-panel screenshot pattern (seed `localStorage['empire-provenance']`
      with a `{state:{edges},version:0}` shape of real registry-id edges → load `/app/network` → shoot) is the cheapest
      way to prove a durable-store render surface; S3's per-entity `LineageTrail` can be confirmed the same way once built.
  - **✅ S3 SHIPPED (2026-07-02) — durable per-entity "From <source>" survives a reload (HEADLINE-METRIC stage).**
    New **`src/components/ui/LineageTrail.tsx`** — `<LineageTrail app from? />`: a glass `role="note"` row (`--mono`,
    aria-label `From <source>`) that renders the direct `<app> ← <from>` pair when a concrete stored `from` is passed,
    else walks `lineageOf(edges, app)`; returns **null** when `chain.length < 2` (no ancestry). Inner `AppToken`
    renders each hop's registry icon + `${app.color}` accent (identity data, no raw hex literal — mirrors
    `ProvenanceChip`). Reactive sub `useProvenance(s => s.edges)`. Added `from?: string` to the persisted shapes:
    `Message` (**`src/lib/store.ts:4`**), local `Goal` (**`Goals.tsx:14`**), local `CalendarEvent` (**`Calendar.tsx:15`**).
    Each app tracks a `draftFrom` state read from **`inbound.payload.from`** (NOT `inbound.source` — see trap) in the
    `[inbound.payload]` effect, stamps it onto the saved entity (Goals `add`, Messages `send`, Calendar `saveEvent`
    non-editing branch), clears it on send / manual-create / dismiss, and renders `{entity.from && <LineageTrail …/>}`
    on the goal card / message bubble / sidebar event row (session `<ProvenanceChip>` kept as the pre-save hint).
    `LineageTrail.test.tsx` (3). build🟢 vitest 236→239🟢 eslint 0; tokens 0, off-system 0; bundle 692.5→693.5.
    - **TRAP (learned this run):** stamp from **`inbound.payload.from`**, keeping the effect deps `[inbound.payload]`
      only. Do NOT read `inbound.source` + add it to the deps — `dismiss()` nulls `source`, which would re-fire the
      prefill effect and **re-fill the form after the user dismissed it**. The payload already carries `from`.
    - **QA guard reconciled (per the S1-confirm trap):** the pre-existing `PROVENANCE-PERSISTS` in `qa-smoke.mjs` tests
      the *edge* store via the Editor Send menu — left UNTOUCHED. Added a **distinct** `PROVENANCE-ENTITY` block (seed
      inbound clipboard → reload+consume+prefill → trigger the app's OWN create/send → reload again → assert
      `[role="note"][aria-label*="<src>"]` still renders off the persisted entity) for `{calculator→goals,
      editor→messages, notes→calendar}` + a `PROVENANCE-ENTITY N/3` REPORT section. `node --check` clean; the headless
      run is QA's to confirm. **Note for QA:** Notes/Learning use their own `from-<src>` tag / `item.from` (NOT
      LineageTrail), so the entity guard covers the 3 apps that actually render `<LineageTrail>`.
    - **✅ QA-CONFIRMED LIVE (2026-07-02, green main `13a48dc`) — S3 done-confirmed, the HEADLINE metric moved.**
      First QA since S3 landed (last QA `3ef0955` confirmed S2 on `f5ab6be`; S3 `13a48dc` landed since). 27/27 render
      clean (0 uncaught JS), vitest **239/239** (+3 `LineageTrail.test.tsx`), eslint 0, `--assert-zero` exit 0. **The
      new `PROVENANCE-ENTITY` guard ran headless 3/3 ✅** — `{calculator→goals, editor→messages, notes→calendar}` each:
      seed inbound → reload+consume+prefill → app's OWN create/send → reload AGAIN (chip gone) → `[role="note"]
      [aria-label*="<src>"]` STILL renders off the persisted entity. **Confirmed the surface VISUALLY too**
      (`s3-lineage-goals.png`): the durable `Goals ← Calculator` LineageTrail pill renders on the "Budget target 294"
      goal card AFTER a reload (off the persisted `goal.from`, not the consumed sessionStorage chip). The S1 edge guard
      `PROVENANCE-PERSISTS` stays 3/3 (left untouched, per the reconciliation note — distinct metric, no clobber). All
      other guards green (SHELL-IS-STYLED, REGISTRY-COVERAGE, INBOUND 3/3, MEDIA 3/3, OFFLINE 5/5, PRECACHE **79**
      no-gap). Metrics: static 194→197 (+3), vitest 236→239 (+3), test files 24→25 (+1), bundle 692.5→693.5 (+1.0, the
      LineageTrail component + per-entity `from` plumbing, no new deps); apps/tokens/off-system ±0. No runtime bug, no
      contradiction. **S1–S3 all green → only S4 (Reader island) remains to CLOSE EPIC-6.** *Visual note:* the
      LineageTrail confirmation used the Goals case; Messages/Calendar are guard-confirmed (3/3) but not separately shot.
  - **✅ S4 SHIPPED (2026-07-02) — Reader's books → the mesh; the last graph-island is closed (EPIC-6 CLOSE).**
    `Reader.tsx` top-level `Reader()` now has a `useEffect([books])` mirroring the WHOLE library via
    `mirrorCollection('book', 'reader', books, { id, title, data: bookNodeData })` (~`Reader.tsx:37`, beside the
    `refresh` callback). **No accumulation needed** (unlike Files): `books = listBooks()` is ALWAYS the entire library,
    not a window, so a direct mirror is prune-safe. Pure shape in new **`src/apps/reader/readerGraph.ts`**
    (`bookNodeData(b)` → `{format, author, progress, highlights: count}`, blob stays in IDB), unit-pinned
    `readerGraph.test.ts` (3). Each library card got `<NodeActions type="book" sourceId={b.id} />` (`Reader.tsx:~163`,
    between the progress % and the Delete button). **`sync.ts`** `make-task` `accepts` now includes `'book'` → the emit
    menu offers Make Task + Make Note (make-note already took any non-note type). Reader = honest **emit-only** source.
    - **New `GRAPH-LEGIBLE` guard in `qa-smoke.mjs`** (after MEDIA-PERSISTS): drives Reader's file `<input>` with a
      `.txt` book (txt/md/docx need NO parser — `extractMeta` just returns the filename fallback; epub/pdf load heavy
      libs), reads `empire-core-graph` from localStorage, asserts a `type==='book' && meta.app==='reader'` node exists,
      reloads, asserts it re-mirrors. **Verified LIVE this run 1/1 ✅** (added/node/persisted all true) — I ran the full
      smoke via the global playwright (NOT a project dep; `ln -s $(npm root -g)/playwright node_modules/`, removed
      after) + `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium-1194`. 27/27 routes clean, all other guards green.
    - **Reuse for any future collection app:** mirror in the component's top-level effect on the collection state; if
      the app shows a *window* onto a bigger space, accumulate the union first (Files precedent) — else a direct
      `mirrorCollection` is fine. Pin the node-`data` shape as a pure `<app>Graph.ts` helper; QA's node-in-graph
      assertion carries the roundtrip jsdom can't.
    - build🟢 vitest 239→242🟢 eslint clean; tokens 0, off-system 0; test files 25→26, bundle 693.5→693.6 (+0.1, no
      new deps). **★ EPIC-6 is CODE-COMPLETE (S1–S4 all shipped, GRAPH-LEGIBLE verified live).**
    - **✅ QA-CONFIRMED LIVE (2026-07-02, green main `e262f1b`) — S4 done-confirmed, EPIC-6 CLOSED.** First QA since S4
      landed (last QA `0f17fc3` confirmed S3 on `13a48dc`; S4 `e262f1b` landed since). 27/27 render clean (0 uncaught
      JS), vitest **242/242** (+3 `readerGraph.test.ts`), eslint 0, `--assert-zero` exit 0. **The new `GRAPH-LEGIBLE`
      guard ran headless 1/1 ✅** (added=true, node=true, persisted=true): Reader's file `<input>` driven with a `.txt`
      book → a `book` CoreNode owned by `app==='reader'` appears in `empire-core-graph` AND the re-mounted Reader
      re-mirrors it after a reload (idempotent, not dropped). Every other guard held green (SHELL-IS-STYLED,
      REGISTRY-COVERAGE 26, INBOUND 3/3, MEDIA 3/3, PROVENANCE-PERSISTS 3/3, PROVENANCE-ENTITY 3/3, OFFLINE 5/5,
      PRECACHE 79 no-gap). Metrics: static 197→200 (+3), vitest 239→242 (+3), test files 25→26 (+1), bundle
      693.5→693.6 (+0.1); apps 26, tokens 0, off-system 0 all ±0. No runtime bug, no contradiction. **★ All four EPIC-6
      acceptance metrics have now moved (PROVENANCE-PERSISTS + PROVENANCE-ENTITY + GRAPH-LEGIBLE) → EPIC-6 is DONE.**
      *Cloud limit:* a fresh-checkout Network canvas is empty, so the book node's live inspector render can't be shot
      headless — the guard carries the mirror→persist→re-mirror roundtrip; on-device is the visual confirm.
      **▶ NEXT = the Strategist promotes the next epic** (no `▶ ACTIVE` epic remains): topmost cloud-executable
      candidates are **node-level lineage** (`lineageOf` in `provenance.ts` is the rail) OR **global cross-app search**;
      EPIC-7 (Android) stays device-gated.
  - **▶ NEXT BUILDER STAGE = none in an active epic — EPIC-6 is DONE (QA-confirmed on-main `e262f1b`).** The Strategist
    should promote the next epic. Queued **cloud-executable** candidates (see EPICS.md ROADMAP + EPIC-6's retire note):
    (a) **node-level lineage** — correlate a `HANDOFF` with the specific entity it created, for true *per-artifact*
    ancestry (the natural depth follow-on to this app-level memory; `lineageOf` in `provenance.ts` is the rail);
    (b) **global cross-app search** — query every app's persisted collection at once. **EPIC-7 (Android) stays
    device-gated** (not cloud-verifiable). If you arrive with no `▶ ACTIVE` epic promoted, take the topmost of these and
    flag EPICS needs the Strategist. **QA to confirm EPIC-6 done on the new green main:** load a book in Reader → it
    appears as a node in The Network + its inspector's entities (the `GRAPH-LEGIBLE` guard proves the mirror headless;
    the visual is the on-device confirm).
  - _(History below retained as working memory; the "no active epic" notes are superseded by the EPIC-6 promotion above.)_
  - **✅ PRIOR QA RUN (2026-07-01, green main `b54461e` — re-confirm, no new code):** Ran against the SAME head as
    the prior QA (`b54461e`; no builder/strategist commit landed since). Re-proved main builds & runs from a fresh
    checkout: **27/27 render clean** (desktop + 26 apps, 0 uncaught JS), vitest **216/216**, all guards green
    (SHELL-IS-STYLED, REGISTRY-COVERAGE, INBOUND 3/3, MEDIA 3/3, OFFLINE 5/5, PRECACHE 78 no-gap). Metrics all ±0
    (apps 26, static test-cases 174, tokens 0, off-system 0 via `--assert-zero` exit 0, bundle 691.4). Screenshots
    overwritten. No active epic → nothing to confirm-move; **no runtime bug, no new contradiction.** Strategist still
    owed the next epic promotion (organism-completeness-II is the topmost cloud-executable candidate).
  - **✅ PRIOR QA RUN (2026-07-01, green main `bf78aa3`):** First visual+smoke confirm after the eslint-restore
    (`287ee03`) + README-regen (`bf78aa3`) commits. **27/27 render clean** (desktop + 26 apps, 0 uncaught JS), vitest
    **216/216**, all guards green (SHELL-IS-STYLED, REGISTRY-COVERAGE, INBOUND 3/3, MEDIA 3/3, OFFLINE 5/5, PRECACHE 78
    no-gap). Metrics all ±0 (apps 26, tokens 0, off-system 0 via `--assert-zero`, bundle 691.4). **Prior QA's
    eslint-debt contradiction RESOLVED:** `npx eslint .` now → **0 problems (exit 0)** and `verify.yml` gates it.
    **No runtime bug, no new contradiction.** No active epic → nothing to confirm-move; Strategist to promote next
    (organism-completeness-II is the topmost cloud-executable candidate).
  - **✅ PRIOR BUILDER RUN (2026-07-01, `287ee03`→`bf78aa3`, no active epic — ROADMAP NOW #1: README truth):**
    **Regenerated the stale README 1:1 from source.** Docs-only, but a real design-system-consistency/hygiene fix —
    the front door misdescribed the whole product. Cross-checked every claim against `src/lib/registry.ts` +
    `package.json` + `colors_and_type.css`. Fixed: "21 Apps"→**26**; centered **"Hermes AI"** (deleted)→**Cakra**;
    21-row inventory→a **26-row table** with the 3 merged tools (Editor/Prompt Gen/Token Counter) marked as hidden
    **Cakra tabs** (launcher shows 23); "glass-morphism/XENO/Inter/#0f172a/#6366f1"→JondriDev **Earth-from-Space**
    Liquid Glass (`.gp`, accent tokens, **Sora**+**JetBrains Mono**, 0 hardcoded colors CI-enforced); fabricated
    versions (Vite 8/TS 6/React 19.2.6/RR 7.15/Lucide 1.16)→real (Vite 5.4/TS 5.6/React 19.2/RR 7.18/Lucide 1.22) +
    added Motion/Leaflet/Reader-parsers/vite-plugin-pwa/Capacitor; Termux prereq+footer→"runs in any browser".
    Reverted 2 env-noise files (`package-lock.json` npm-normalization, `docs/metrics.json` timestamp churn) → final
    diff = **README.md only**. build🟢 vitest 216 (±0) metrics all ±0 (tokens 0, off-system 0, bundle 691.4). **▶ NEXT
    cloud-executable = organism-completeness-II** (see Open follow-ups) — but the `aliasOf`-reroute win **must first
    confirm the Cakra tab receives the `empire-*-clipboard` handoff**, else it regresses a working standalone receiver.
    EPICS still needs the Strategist.
  - **▶ EARLIER BUILDER RUN (2026-06-30, `95300b3`→ `287ee03`, no active epic — FIX broken: the lint gate):**
    **Restored eslint to green + locked it in CI.** The last QA flagged `npx eslint .` was NOT clean (2 errors + 6
    warnings) while CI stayed green (verify.yml had **no eslint step**). **Fix:** split the icons module —
    `git mv icons/index.tsx → icons/glyphs.tsx` (now a pure *component* module: 27 glyph components + the `AppIcon`
    type only), new **`icons/index.ts`** barrel holds the non-component surface (`alienIcons` map + `getAppIcon`;
    `FallbackIcon` internalized) with **zero component exports** so `react-refresh/only-export-components` can't fire.
    Public import path (`from '../design-system/icons'`) unchanged → `registry.ts` untouched. Deleted 6 unused
    `no-explicit-any` disable directives in `reader/lib/render/{epub,pdf}.ts` (that rule isn't enabled). **Added an
    `npx eslint .` step to `verify.yml`** (errors fail CI red — the EPIC-5-S8-style lock). build🟢 eslint **0
    problems** (was 2err/6warn) vitest 216 (±0, pure refactor) metrics all ±0 (tokens 0, off-system 0, bundle 691.4).
    **organism-completeness-II investigated → NOT broken** (deferred): the Cakra merge kept standalone Editor/
    Token-Counter/Prompt-Gen as `aliasOf` apps; `appActions` handoffs (`window.open('/app/editor')` → `AppShell` →
    standalone component w/ `useInboundHandoff`) still **land**. Its only win is making deep-links resolve to Cakra
    *tabs* (via `openAppById`/`setCakraTab`) — a non-cloud-verifiable polish, not a bug.
  - **▶ PRIOR BUILDER RUN (2026-06-30, no active epic — took the topmost cloud-executable open-follow-up):**
    **Files whole-state graph-mirror.** Fixed a real organism bug: `mirrorCollection` prunes unseen nodes, so Files
    mirroring only the *current* directory **dropped every file from prior folders on navigate** — the graph never
    saw more than one directory. New pure **`src/apps/files/filesGraph.ts`** (`accumulateFiles` union by path +
    `dirOf` + `fileNodeData`); `Files.tsx` now holds the session union in a `useRef` and mirrors the **whole union**
    (navigating ADDS; ref bounds to one session + self-cleans on reload via the first prune pass). `file` node `data`
    now also carries `dir`. New `filesGraph.test.ts` (8). build🟢 vitest 208→216🟢 eslint clean; tokens 0, off-system
    0, bundle 691.3→691.4. **DataCenter follow-up was STALE** — `DataCenter.tsx:57` already mirrors *all* tables with
    per-table row counts, not just the active one (the "active table only" note predated the redesign). **▶ NEXT
    cloud-executable: organism-completeness-II** — re-audit both-ways wiring vs the post-redesign 26-route registry
    (Cakra merge folded Prompt-Gen/Token-Counter/Editor into tabs; Reader is new; `SendResultMenu`/`useInboundHandoff`
    targets may point at routes that changed). EPICS still needs the Strategist to formalize an epic.
  EPIC-5's whole metric was realized **out-of-band** by the user-directed redesign batch (commits `75ef685`…`fb4c853`,
  2026-06-30: full-screen app model — *windows deleted*; Prompt-Gen/Token-Counter/Editor *merged into Cakra*; a new
  **Reader** app; and `98c61c7` "token-ize Tailwind palette classes across all apps" which drove every file's
  off-system count to 0). **S8 (this run, `f9dbf10`) LOCKED it** so it can't rot — see below.
  - **▶ NEXT BUILDER STAGE = none pre-decomposed.** If you arrive with no `▶ ACTIVE` epic: EPIC-6 (Android) is
    device-gated/QUEUED (not cloud-verifiable). The next **cloud-executable** gradients (Strategist to formalize into
    stages): (a) **DataCenter/Files whole-state graph-mirror** — both only mirror the *active table* / *current
    directory* today (see "Open follow-ups" below); (b) **organism-completeness-II** — the Cakra merge + Reader
    changed the app surface (now 26 routes), so re-audit both-ways wiring against the new registry. Until an epic is
    promoted, the builder takes the topmost ROADMAP NOW item and flags EPICS needs the Strategist.
  - **✅ EPIC-5 S8 SHIPPED (this run, 2026-06-30) — LOCKED off-system 0 (EPIC-5 CLOSE).** off-system was already 0
    (the redesign batch swept S1–S7's mass; nothing left to migrate), so this run made the 0 **un-rottable**:
    (1) wired a **`design-system conformance` CI step** into `.github/workflows/verify.yml` running
    `node scripts/metrics.mjs --assert-zero` (gate at `scripts/metrics.mjs:235-247`, exits 1 if `tokenViolations>0 ||
    offSystemUtilities>0`) — beside the shell-styled + route-parity guards; (2) added
    **`src/design-system/themeBridge.test.ts`** (3 cases) — parses the `@theme inline` block in `src/index.css` and
    asserts every `--color-*` utility resolves to a `--token` declared in `colors_and_type.css` (+ a parse-floor so a
    broken regex can't pass vacuously). A re-introduced off-system class **or** a drifted bridge var now fails CI red.
    build🟢 vitest 205→208🟢 eslint clean; tokens 0, off-system 0 (live grep). **Trap (still live):** `metrics.mjs`
    greps text — a raw `rgb(`/`#hex` *even in a comment* regresses `tokenViolations`; the CI gate now catches it.
    **The `@theme inline` bridge is `src/index.css:25-49`** (16 `--color-*` utilities → `var(--token)`), token
    declarations in `src/design-system/colors_and_type.css` (`:root` + `[data-theme]` blocks). **`Clock.tsx` is the
    0-off-system reference idiom** for any future class→token work.
  - **⚠️ REDESIGN BATCH 2026-06-30 (out-of-band, between QA `1d2c052` and this run) — read before "fixing" deltas:**
    apps **25 → 26** (Reader added; Prompt-Gen/Token-Counter/Editor folded into **Cakra** but route count rose net +1
    — the Reader); **windows deleted** (full-screen "Apple-style" app model — `src/components/Window.tsx` gone, new
    `AppHost.tsx`/`Recents.tsx`, `src/lib/cakraTab.ts`); **bundle gz 292.5 → 691.3** (the Reader pulls EPUB/PDF/DOCX
    parsers — by design, do NOT strip them). off-system 0, tokens 0 held. **✅ QA-CONFIRMED VISUALLY 2026-06-30
    (green main `c51f79f`):** all 26 routes (27 incl. desktop) render clean, 0 uncaught JS, vitest 208/208.
    Verified — the windowless full-screen shell (centered alien-icon launcher grid + bottom dock), the new Reader
    (empty-state, EPUB/PDF/MD/TXT/DOCX, "ask Cakra as you read"), the merged Cakra (Chat/Prompt/Tokens/Code tabs +
    Workspace panel), Maps real Leaflet container. **Added `reader` to the `qa-smoke.mjs` smoke list** (the new
    registry app was missing from it — would have thrown REGISTRY-COVERAGE).
  - **✅ EPIC-4 fully DONE & QA-CONFIRMED (2026-06-29, green main `d17f73a`/`1d2c052`) — PWA: offline ✅ + base ✅ +
    installable ✅ (4 icons).** All S1–S4 shipped; every acceptance metric confirmed-moved by QA. EPIC-4 history
    seams retained below.
  - **✅ EPIC-4 S4 SHIPPED (2026-06-29, EPIC-4 CLOSE):** installability assertion. *Investigated Lighthouse first* —
    no `lighthouse` dep (registry reachable, v13.4.0) but it'd add a heavy devDep + flaky headless browser, wrong fit
    for the unattended routine → took the pure-auditor fallback. Added **`auditInstallability(manifest)`** +
    **`maxIconSize(sizes)`** to `scripts/pwaBaseAudit.mjs` (name+short_name; a ≥192 AND a ≥512 `any`-purpose icon; a
    `maskable` icon; standalone-ish `display` incl. via `display_override`; `start_url`; `background_color`+`theme_color`).
    Returns per-criterion `criteria{}` + flat `missing[]`. Folded into `auditPwaBase` (issues join the base-path issues)
    + surfaced by `check-pwa-base.mjs` (console line + PWA-BASE.md Installability table). `pwaBaseAudit.test.mjs` 17→29
    (+12). `node scripts/check-pwa-base.mjs` → **installable ✅ (4 icons)**. vitest 193→205, tokens 0, bundle 292.5 —
    all no-regression. **Trap learned:** a maskable-ONLY icon must NOT count toward the `any` size buckets (Chrome
    needs an `any` icon for the home-screen) — filter `iconPurposes(i).includes('any')` before the ≥192/≥512 check.
  - **✅ EPIC-4 S3 SHIPPED (2026-06-29):** base-path/install-flow correctness. New pure auditor
    `scripts/pwaBaseAudit.mjs` (`auditPwaBase` aggregates `auditHtmlBase`/`auditSwBase`/`auditRegisterSw`/
    `auditManifest`; `extractHtmlAssetUrls`, `normalizeBase`) + `pwaBaseAudit.test.mjs` (17 cases) + runner
    `scripts/check-pwa-base.mjs` (builds with `--base=/empire/ --outDir=dist-pwa-base-check`, gitignored, cleaned
    up; audits asset prefixes + sw navigateFallback + registerSW scope + relative manifest). **Fixed:** manifest
    `id:'/'`→`id:'empire'` in `vite.config.ts` (`id` resolves vs `start_url`'s ORIGIN per MDN, so root `/` collides
    on shared `github.io`; `'empire'` = stable `<origin>/empire` identity for every base). `node
    scripts/check-pwa-base.mjs` ✅. vitest 176→193 (+17), tokens 0, bundle 292.5 — all no-regression.
  - **✅ EPIC-4 S1 SHIPPED + S2 NO-OP (2026-06-29):** see seams below — `scripts/precacheAudit.mjs` (pure parse +
    audit, 6 unit tests), `scripts/qa-offline.mjs` (cold-offline boot guard via `setOffline(true)`, 5/5 routes),
    wired into `qa-smoke.mjs`. **Precache has ZERO gap** (63 entries cover all 37 JS + 2 CSS + fonts/icons), so S2
    needed no code. EPIC-4's `offline-boots` metric now has a concrete green guard for QA to confirm-move.
  - **✅ EPIC-3 CODE-COMPLETE (2026-06-29) — all of S1–S4 shipped, function metric 8/8 (QA-confirmed at S3).**
  - **✅ S4 SHIPPED (2026-06-29, EPIC-3 CLOSE):** extracted the pure logic out of the two logic-heavy redesign
    instruments into named modules + tests, mirroring `clockLogic.ts`. `src/apps/datacenter/datacenterLogic.ts`
    (`DCStore` types + tolerant `deserializeStore`/`serializeStore` + immutable `addRow`/`updateCell`/`deleteRow`/
    `addTable`/`deleteTable`/`normalizeTableName` — all return a fresh store, no React; no-op when the table is
    gone) + `datacenterLogic.test.ts` (12 cases). `src/apps/weather/weatherLogic.ts` (`Cat`/`WeatherData`/
    `OpenMeteo*` types + `wmo()` code map + pure `mapForecast(data, place)` that rounds/caps-at-5/tolerates-missing-
    daily) + `weatherLogic.test.ts` (8 cases). Both components rewired to delegate (zero behaviour change). test-
    files 19→21, test cases +21, token-violations 0 (±0), bundle 292.2→292.3. **Reuse pattern:** any app with inline
    pure logic → extract to `<app>Logic.ts`, keep React/DS-specific bits (icons, colour maps) in the component.
  - **✅ S3 SHIPPED (2026-06-29):** Photos library now survives a reload — ported `Photos.tsx` to the shared
    `mediaStore` IDB rail 1:1 from Music (`url`→`src`, async-rehydrate behind `hydratedRef`, persist meta only,
    `putMedia`/`deleteMedia`, oversized→`ephemeral`+amber "session" chip in grid & list). New
    `src/apps/photos/photosStore.test.ts` (6 cases pin the Photo strip/rehydrate contract). **Function 7/8 → 8/8.**
  - **✅ S2 SHIPPED (2026-06-28):** Music + Video libraries now survive a reload. Real `Blob`s live in IDB via
    the new shared `src/lib/mediaStore.ts`; only metadata persists; ghosts (missing blobs) are dropped on
    rehydrate; oversized files stay session-only (`ephemeral`, "session-only" hint). See seam + trap below.
  - EPIC-1 (Organism Completeness) **DONE & QA-confirmed** (both-ways 9/9). EPIC-2 (Design-system
    conformance) **DONE 2026-06-28** — token-violations **501 → 0** across S1–S8 (see below).
- **🛸 THE BRIDGE LANDED (2026-07-03) — user-directed "living home" pass; do NOT revert.** The home
  launcher stopped being a mute grid: **The Bridge** renders the organism's real state at home.
  - **What shipped:** pure selector spine **`src/lib/core/bridge.ts`** (`bridgeSnapshot` = today's events /
    open tasks / goal stats / recent entities / organism stats / greeting slot + `agoLabel`; `bridge.test.ts`
    12 cases, the `tasks.ts`/`search.ts` discipline) + **`src/components/Bridge.tsx`** rendered above the app
    grid inside a new `.empire-home-wrap` (Desktop.tsx): bilingual greeting (EN/ID, time-of-day), a **Cakra
    ask line** (hands off over the same `empire-ai-clipboard` rail every app uses — no `from`, home is not a
    registry app, provenance stays honest), **four live widgets** (Today→calendar, Open Tasks→inbox,
    Goals→goals with avg-progress bar, Organism→network), and a **jump-back-in strip** (5 newest content
    nodes, exact-landing via `openEntity`). All reads flow from ONE reactive `useGraph` through the pure
    selectors — no private stores, fully offline.
  - **CSS:** new BRIDGE section in `window-manager.css`, token-pure (`--card-*`, `--r-*`, `color-mix` on
    `--app-color`); launcher switched to `justify-content:flex-start` + `margin:auto` wrap (centers short,
    scrolls tall). **Trap fixed:** the global `input[type="text"]` glass rule out-specifies a single class —
    the ask input needed `.bridge-ask input.bridge-ask-input` to stay transparent inside its pill.
  - **Guard:** **`HOME-ALIVE`** in `qa-smoke.mjs` (seed today-`event`/open-`task`/`book` → reload → widgets
    show counts+entities, strip lists 3 newest-first, row-click lands in Reader, ask line opens Cakra
    prefilled) + REPORT section. Seed types follow the GLOBAL-SEARCH graph-survivable rule.
  - **Also:** the last stale brand string — the PWA manifest shortcut "Hermes AI Chat" (vite.config.ts) — is
    now "Cakra — AI Chat" (`grep -ri hermes` is 0 again).
  - **🐛 Pre-existing bug found & fixed by the HOME-ALIVE ask leg:** the `ai-chat-open-context` automation
    rule (automation.ts) consumed **and removed** `empire-ai-clipboard` on `APP_OPENED(ai-chat)` while its
    "dispatch" is a no-op (`buildDispatch` builds an object nobody receives). Since `emit()` is synchronous
    and BOTH Cakra surfaces emit `APP_OPENED` in an effect declared *before* their clipboard-read effect,
    **every handoff payload into Cakra was destroyed before the prefill could read it.** Fix: the rule no
    longer removes the key (the reading surface consumes-and-clears); AgentSurface also stopped rendering a
    `From undefined:` prefix when a payload has no `from`. INBOUND-LANDS never caught this because ai-chat
    was only ever tested as a *sender*; HOME-ALIVE now pins ai-chat as a *receiver*.
- **🎨 REDESIGN LANDED (2026-06-28) — user-directed "JondriDev pass"; do NOT revert.** A first-principles
  overhaul of The Empire. **Intentional metric deltas — read before "fixing" them:**
  - **apps 27 → 25 is BY DESIGN:** deleted `ai-agent` (Hermes Agent) + `hermes-cc` (Hermes CC) and folded
    the agent's tool-calling into the single **Cakra** app (`src/apps/cakra/`; route still `/app/ai-chat`,
    id `ai-chat`, name **Cakra**). **Do NOT re-add the deleted apps** to lift "apps/routes".
  - **bundle gz +~40 KB is BY DESIGN:** **Maps** renders a real interactive **Leaflet + OSM** map (`leaflet`
    dep, lazy-loaded inside the Maps chunk). **Do NOT strip `leaflet`** to shrink the bundle.
  - **token-violations stay 0** — every changed/new app consumes DS tokens (`var(--c-*)` / `tint`).
  - **Palette swapped XENO → JondriDev Earth-from-Space** in `colors_and_type.css` (bridge *re-valued*, names
    kept). **App icons** are now a bespoke **alien SVG set** in `src/design-system/icons/` (via `getAppIcon`),
    NOT Lucide (Lucide stays only for in-app control affordances).
  - **Cut decorative chrome:** `HeroHud.tsx` + `HermesAgentBar.tsx` deleted; zero Hermes branding
    (`grep -ri hermes src` = 0).
  - **Made real (this directly ADVANCES EPIC-3):** Weather=Open-Meteo (no key), Maps=Leaflet+Nominatim,
    Language=Cakra `chat()` translation, DataCenter=local-first localStorage (works offline, no server).
  - **✅ QA-CONFIRMED 2026-06-28 on green main `23df6ce`** (first QA after the redesign; remote was
    force-rebased mid-run so QA re-ran against the redesigned tree, not pre-redesign `b12b835`): build 🟢,
    **smoke 26/26 render clean** (desktop + 25 apps, 0 uncaught JS), vitest **115/115**, **token-violations 0**
    (held through the whole redesign), SHELL-IS-STYLED ✅, REGISTRY-COVERAGE ✅, INBOUND-LANDS **3/3**. Verified
    visually: new Earth-from-Space palette + alien icons + Cakra; **Maps shows the real Leaflet container**
    (zoom + OSM attribution) — only tiles grey (OSM/CARTO egress-blocked = `maps` net:8 / `weather` net:1,
    env-expected). **No runtime regressions.** Metrics: apps 27→25, gz 248→288.6 (both by design), tokens 0.
  - **QA harness:** added a **reverse REGISTRY-COVERAGE guard** to `scripts/qa-smoke.mjs` (smoke-list ⊆
    registry) so a deleted/renamed app left in the smoke list fails loudly instead of red-ing the run as a
    phantom `/app/<id>` route — the exact drift this redesign (deleting ai-agent+hermes-cc) could have caused.
  - **⚠️ EPIC-3 still has NO formal stages and NO declared target metric.** The redesign advanced the *intent*
    (4 instruments made real) but there is no acceptance number to confirm-move. **Strategist must seed EPIC-3
    stages + a target metric** (e.g. "N/5 shallow instruments offline-capable + a unit test") before the next
    builder run, or EPIC-3 progress stays unmeasurable.
- **EPIC-2 S1 DONE (2026-06-23):** built `src/design-system/tokens.ts` (the TS palette seam:
  `PALETTE` + `cssVar(name)→'var(--name)'` + `tint(name,pct)→'color-mix(in srgb, var(--name) pct%, transparent)'`,
  rounds+clamps; `tokens.test.ts` 4 cases) and swept the **Hermes cluster** to zero:
  `HermesCommandCenter.tsx` 64→0 + `HermesAgentBar.tsx` 49→0. **token-violations 501 → 388 (−113).**
- **EPIC-2 S2 DONE (this run, 2026-06-27):** swept the next cluster to zero with the `cssVar`/`tint` rails —
  `ai-agent/components/SettingsPanel.tsx` 38→0, `apps/calculator/Calculator.tsx` 38→0,
  `artifacts/artifacts/MarkdownStudio.tsx` 29→0. **token-violations 388 → 283 (−105).** Mappings used: amber/orange
  (`#f59e0b`/`#f97316`/`#fb923c`)→`ember`, slate-dark panel (`#111827`)→`cssVar('abyss')`, slate border
  (`#1e2d4a`)→`tint('xenon',10)` (button fill→`tint('ion',22)`), green→`c-success`, red→`c-danger`, cyan→`signal`,
  text greys (`#f1f5f9`/`#94a3b8`/`#475569`)→`text`/`text2`/`text3`, white-glass→`tint('xenon',N)`,
  black-shadow→`tint('void',N)`. **Gradient/darken idiom:** `color-mix(in srgb, var(--ember) 70%, var(--void))` to
  darken and `color-mix(in srgb, var(--ember) 80%, var(--text))` to lighten — works inside both inline styles AND
  the `<style>{`…`}</style>` template literal (interpolate `${cssVar(...)}`/`${tint(...)}`). build🟢 vitest 107🟢
  eslint clean.
- **EPIC-2 S3 DONE (this run, 2026-06-27):** swept the **shared UI primitives cluster** with the `cssVar`/`tint`
  rails — `components/ui/index.tsx` 26→0 (Button primary/danger, Input/TextArea focus borders, full `badgeColors`
  map, Badge custom-`color` prop, Divider), `ai-agent/components/ModelPicker.tsx` 24→0 (overlay/panel chrome,
  Cakra-Auto toggle, provider tabs, model list, API-key status), + the 3 safe DOM hex fallbacks in
  `apps/network/Network.tsx` (`var(--signal, #34f5d6)`→`var(--signal)`, 24→21). New mapping learned: **NVIDIA-green
  `#76b900`→`aurora`**, white→`xenon`. **Alpha-append trap fixed in two spots** (`${color}18` / `${p.color}22`,
  `+'44'`) → `color-mix(in srgb, ${var} N%, transparent)` (0x18≈9, 0x22≈13, 0x44≈27). **token-violations 321 → 268
  (−53).** build🟢 vitest 107🟢 eslint clean. *(Baseline was 321 not 283: the two post-S2 Cakra commits regressed
  +38.)*
- **EPIC-2 S4 DONE (this run, 2026-06-27):** (a) **exempted `lib/registry.ts`** in `scripts/metrics.mjs` (`DS_INFRA`
  set) — it's the per-app accent *identity manifest*, the single source consumed across the shell as `${app.color}`/
  `rgbOf` (37 consumers, many `${app.color}NN` alpha-append → migration too risky/large; exempting palette-data is
  principled). (b) **de-hexed the Network canvas** — every `rgba(${triplet},a)` + the `#34f5d6` label fill now go
  through `rgbCss(triplet, alpha)`; added accent triplet consts to `nodeColors.ts` (`SIGNAL`/`ION`/`PLASMA`/`VOID`).
  `Network.tsx` reports 0. New `nodeColors.test.ts` (5). **token-violations 268 → 221 (−47).** build🟢 vitest 112🟢
  eslint clean.
- **EPIC-2 S5 DONE (this run, 2026-06-27):** swept the **entire ai-agent app's render code** to zero with the
  `cssVar`/`tint` rails — `Agent.tsx` 17→0, `components/ChatPanel.tsx` 19→0, `components/ConfirmModal.tsx` 16→0,
  `components/WorkspacePanel.tsx` 16→0, `components/ThinkingTrace.tsx` 6→0, + the semantic activity accents in
  `lib/activityStore.ts` 8→0 (thinking→`signal`, write/shell→`ember`, search/fetch→`plasma`, code→`c-success`; the
  `accent` field flows into `<StatusIcon color>` so `cssVar(...)` works). New mappings confirmed: NVIDIA-green
  `#76b900`→`aurora`, black-scrim `rgba(0,0,0,0.7)`→`tint('void',70)`, slate panel `#111827`→`abyss`. **HTML-string
  alpha-append trap:** ChatPanel's inline `<code style="background:…">` lives in a `.replace()` arg — convert that
  arg from a `'…'` string to a `` `…` `` template literal so `${tint('ion',15)}` interpolates (the `$1` backref stays
  literal in a template literal). **Exempted `ai-agent/lib/providers.ts`** in `metrics.mjs` `DS_INFRA` — per-PROVIDER
  brand-accent identity manifest (registry precedent; two providers are blue `#4285f4`/`#3b82f6` → would both collapse
  to `ion`). **token-violations 221 → 134 (−87).** build🟢 vitest 112🟢 eslint clean.
- **EPIC-2 S6 DONE (this run, 2026-06-28):** swept the **entire artifacts app** to zero with a new shared
  categorical rail. **Added `export const CATEGORICAL: string[]` to `tokens.ts`** = `[cssVar('ion'),cssVar('signal'),
  cssVar('ember'),cssVar('plasma'),cssVar('aurora'),cssVar('c-warn'),cssVar('c-danger'),cssVar('xenon')]` — **8
  distinct-HEX accents** (deliberately chose aurora+c-warn over the spec's `c-success`/`c-info`, which collapse onto
  aurora/signal — `new Set(CATEGORICAL).size===8` for genuinely distinct *colours*, not just distinct strings). The
  canonical "N-distinct-series" rail; index `CATEGORICAL[i % len]`. Migrated: `ChartBuilder.tsx` (`COLORS = CATEGORICAL`;
  SVG grid `rgba(255,255,255,0.06)`→`tint('xenon',6)`, cyan line/area/stops `#22d3ee`→`cssVar('signal')`, pie scrim
  `rgba(0,0,0,0.4)`→`tint('void',40)` — **SVG `stroke`/`stopColor`/`fill` accept `var(--…)` AND `color-mix(…)`**),
  `Kanban.tsx` (columns→`cssVar('ion'/'signal'/'c-success')`, `TAG_COLORS = CATEGORICAL`, seed `tagColor`→`CATEGORICAL[n]`),
  `FormBuilder.tsx` (field colors→`CATEGORICAL[i]`, 9th wraps `[8%len]`), `ArtifactGallery.tsx` + `ArtifactsApp.tsx`
  (per-artifact accents→matching `cssVar` tokens, **same 6-token mapping in both** so the launch chrome matches the
  card: form→ion, chart→signal, kanban→c-danger, flashcards→aurora, markdown→c-warn, palette→plasma). **Alpha-append
  trap hit 6×** (`${accent}80/30/15/40`, `t.tagColor+'33'`, `${accent}25`) — all → `color-mix(in srgb, ${x} N%, transparent)`
  (0x80=50,0x33=20,0x30=19,0x25=15,0x15=8,0x40=25,0x10=6). **Content-hex trap:** ArtifactGallery's palette-card
  `preview` ASCII held literal `#6366f1 #ec4899` → replaced with `▦ 7 harmonies` (decorative, not a swatch).
  **Exempted `artifacts/artifacts/ColorPalette.tsx` in `metrics.mjs` `DS_INFRA`** — colour-theory tool, hexes ARE
  content. `tokens.test.ts` +3 (len/var-shape/uniqueness/real-token). **token-violations 134 → 59 (−75: −52 swept,
  −23 exempted).** build🟢 vitest 115🟢 eslint clean.
- **EPIC-2 S7 DONE (this run, 2026-06-28):** swept the **7 shared-UI + shell surfaces** to zero with the `cssVar`/`tint`
  rails — `Toast.tsx` 16→0 (collapsed the 4-entry hex map into a `variantAccent` map of one `TokenName` each:
  success→`c-success`/error→`c-danger`/info→`signal`/warning→`c-warn`; `ToastCard` derives stripe=`cssVar(accent)`,
  fg=`color-mix(… var(--accent) 70%, var(--text))`, bg=`tint(accent,12)`; panel→`tint('void',85)`, glass→`tint('xenon',N)`,
  shadow→`tint('void',N)`), `ErrorBoundary.tsx` 7→0 (`tint('c-danger',30)` + lightened heading), `ui/Utility.tsx` 6→0
  (icon chips→`tint('signal',8/18)`, StatCard delta→`cssVar('c-success'/'c-danger')`), `Desktop.tsx` 6→0 (shadows/borders
  →`tint`, opaque badge border `rgba(13,18,36,1)`→`var(--abyss)`; **kept `${app.color}`** registry identity),
  `Dashboard.tsx` 4→0 (amber fav chips→`tint('c-warn',N)`), `AppShell.tsx` 3→0, `ui/NodeActions.tsx` 3→0 (signal hovers
  →`cssVar('signal')`/`tint('signal',N)`). **New mapping confirmed:** lighten an accent for legible fg/heading text via
  `color-mix(in srgb, var(--accent) 70%, var(--text))`; opaque dark panel border→`var(--abyss)` (not a tint).
  **token-violations 59 → 14 (−45).** build🟢 vitest 115🟢 eslint clean.
- **EPIC-2 S8 DONE (this run, 2026-06-28) — token-violations 14 → 0, EPIC-2 CLOSED.** Swept the long-tail with the
  `cssVar`/`tint` rails (logic untouched, colours only): `Notes.tsx` 6→0 (`#eab308`→`cssVar('c-warn')`, action accents
  `#a855f7`→`plasma`/`#ef4444`→`c-danger`, footer border→`tint('xenon',4)`, analyze hover→`tint('signal',8)`,
  **alpha-append `${accent}1F`→`color-mix(… 12%)`** + fallback→`tint('xenon',6)`), `Goals.tsx` 3→0 (dropped DOM hex
  fallbacks `var(--void,#hex)`→`var(--void)`, `var(--ember,#hex)`→`var(--ember)` — same idiom as S3's Network fix),
  `AIChat.tsx` 2→0 (banner→`tint('signal',5)`, scrim→`tint('void',60)`), `Calendar.tsx`/`Weather.tsx` 1→0 each (modal
  scrims→`tint('void',60)`), `nodeColors.ts` 1→0 (**the lone literal was in a CODE COMMENT** — `metrics.mjs` greps prose;
  rephrased to drop the `rgb`-function spelling, `rgbCss` rail intact). **All 14 gone; metrics confirms 0.** build🟢
  vitest 115🟢 eslint clean.
  - **Reusable rail for data files:** if a file's colours are genuine external/brand/content identities that must stay
    distinct (registry, providers, ColorPalette swatches), add its repo-relative path to `DS_INFRA` in
    `scripts/metrics.mjs` with a one-line rationale — don't force-map identity data onto internal tokens. For
    *decorative* N-distinct series (charts/tags/fields), use the new `CATEGORICAL` sequence instead of exempting.
- **S6c done (this run, 2026-06-23):** all 9 entity-owning apps that honestly take input are now
  both-ways. Added `SEND_TO_CALENDAR` / `SEND_TO_GOALS` / `SEND_TO_MESSAGES` to
  `src/lib/appActions.ts` (each writes `empire-<x>-clipboard` `{text,title?,from}`, `handoff(...)`s,
  `window.open('/app/<x>','_self')`). Receivers wired with the S1 rail:
  - **Calendar** (`Calendar.tsx`): inbound opens the **New Event** modal prefilled (title = payload
    title or first line; description = text if a title was given; date = today). **Trap respected** —
    wired into Calendar's OWN create flow; NO central `event` syncer (that would delete its
    self-mirrored `empire-calendar-events` nodes).
  - **Goals** (`Goals.tsx`): inbound prefills the always-visible **New Goal** form (title + description).
  - **Messages** (`Messages.tsx`): inbound prefills the composer **draft** (chip above the textarea).
  Each renders `<ProvenanceChip from={inbound.source} onDismiss={inbound.dismiss}/>`. All three added
  to `SendResultMenu`'s `ACTION_TARGET` + `DEFAULT_ACTIONS` so the loop is UI-reachable (and the apps
  self-filter so they never offer to send to themselves). `appActions.test.ts` HANDOFF `it.each` cases
  extended +3. **both-ways 6/9 → 9/9.** build🟢 vitest🟢 (103) eslint clean; token-violations 501 (±0).
  *Cloud limit:* the source→target Network arc needs a seeded graph + cross-page nav, not screenshottable.
- **S6b done:** shared `src/components/ui/SendResultMenu.tsx` — glass `gp` dropdown modeled on
  `NodeActions` (roving-focus kbd nav; disabled on empty text; `ACTION_TARGET` map drops any action
  whose target === source). Wired into Editor / TokenCounter / AIChat. Each item runs an existing
  `CROSS_APP_ACTIONS[key].execute({text,title,source})` → that executor already `handoff(...)`s. **Token
  trap avoided:** hover tints use `color-mix(in srgb, var(--signal) N%, transparent)` — NOT raw
  `rgba(...)`, which `scripts/metrics.mjs` greps as a violation even in JS strings. **S6a done:**
  `ProvenanceChip` also renders for Notes cards + Learning items (`LearningItem.from?:string`).

## 🧩 SOLVER LANDED (2026-07-04) — user-directed "AI Problem Solver"; do NOT refactor away

Cakra is now the **Problem Solver**: a Solver tab in CakraShell (`src/apps/cakra/solver/`) where problems
(world catalog + user-added + ⚡ `make-problem` intent + routine discoveries) decompose into trees and get
critiqued action plans, plus an auto-queue that works the backlog by severity×tractability under a daily
AI-call budget (default 100, user-tunable, hard stop button).

- **Seams:** `solver/store.ts` (zustand `empire-solver`, source of truth; self-mirrors `problem`/`solution`
  nodes via `mirrorCollection` — do NOT add central sync.ts syncers for these types, same rule as Calendar) ·
  `solver/engine.ts` (4 pure stages — analyze/decompose/solve/critique — over an injected chatFn → lib/ai
  `chat()`, JSON-extract + one strict retry) · `solver/queue.ts` (`nextStageFor`/`pickNext`/`rollupIds`
  unit-pinned; 2 engine strikes → `blocked`; transport failure stops the queue) · `solver/solverIntents.ts`
  (registered from `main.tsx`) · registry id `solver` = hidden alias → `ai-chat` tab `solver` (mapped in
  appComponents + the qa-smoke list; route-parity green both directions).
- **World feed:** `public/solver/feed.json` is OWNED by the **World-Solver routine** (routine #8, daily) —
  it web-researches cited briefs for catalog problems and appends fresh `discovery` problems, then commits
  here; the app fetches it read-only (`solver/feed.ts`, 404-safe). Builder/Strategist: do not hand-edit or
  delete `feed.json`; extending the Solver UI/graph wiring in future epics is fair game.
- **Intentional metric deltas (NOT regressions):** apps 28 → 29 (the alias id), vitest +~20 solver cases
  (3 new test files), small bundle bump — the eager slice is only store+catalog+intents; engine/queue/UI
  live in the lazy solver chunk.

## 🧭 Codebase seams (where the important things live)

- **Organism core (B-backbone / A-bus / C-intents):**
  - `src/lib/eventBus.ts` — typed pub/sub. Carries `NODE_*` / `INTENT_*` and the
    generic **`HANDOFF { fromId; toId; label? }`** cross-app transfer event.
  - `src/lib/core/graph.ts` — the shared world-state graph (`CoreNode`, Zustand+persist
    store `empire-core-graph`; `addNode/updateNode/deleteNode/link/unlink`, selectors
    `nodesOfType/neighbors/useNodesOfType`). Unit-tested.
  - **`src/lib/core/provenance.ts` (EPIC-6 S1, 2026-07-02):** the organism's *durable memory of movement*. Zustand+
    persist store `useProvenance` (key `empire-provenance`, `{edges: ProvEdge[]}` + `record`/`clear`); `ProvEdge =
    {fromApp,toApp,label?,at}`. Pure exported helpers (unit-tested, no store/React): `recordEdges(edges,edge,now)`
    (coalesce a same-pair edge within `DEDUP_MS=1500` → bump `at`+label, else append+cap to `MAX_EDGES=500`),
    `edgesInto`/`edgesFrom` (newest-first filters), `lineageOf(edges,appId,maxDepth=6)` (newest-inbound walk backwards,
    cycle-guarded). **EPIC-6 S2 added panel-selection helpers:** `ProvNeighbor{app,at,label?}`;
    `fedBy(edges,appId)`/`feeds(edges,appId)` (de-duped `ProvNeighbor[]`, first-wins over the newest-first list =
    newest edge per app) + `recentEdges(edges,n=12)` (`slice(-n).reverse()`) — the pure selection behind the Network
    inspector Fed-by/Feeds + the durable Memory panel. `startProvenanceTracking()` (module `started` guard, mirror `focus.ts`) subscribes `onAny` and
    records **exactly `flowForEvent(e)`** — the ONE honest edge source, never an invented link. Started once at
    `main.tsx:20`. **This is the spine for S2 (Network memory) / S3 (durable per-entity source) / S4 (Reader island).**
  - `src/lib/core/intents.ts` — `registerIntent/intentsFor/runIntent`. Graph-mutating
    core intents (`make-task`, `make-note-from`, `add-to-learning`) are registered in
    `src/lib/core/sync.ts` (they need `useGraph`), not here.
  - `src/lib/core/sync.ts` — `startCoreSync()` (called once in `main.tsx`); `mirrorCollection()`.
    **⚠️ `mirrorCollection` PRUNES** (`reconcile` deletes any `<type>` node whose `sourceId` isn't in the batch).
    An app surfacing a *window* onto a larger space (Files = one directory at a time) must NOT hand it only the
    current window or it deletes everything else — accumulate the union first. See `src/apps/files/filesGraph.ts`
    (`accumulateFiles` builds a session-union `Map<path,…>`; `Files.tsx` mirrors `[...union.values()]`). DataCenter
    is fine — it already mirrors all tables at once.
  - **`src/lib/core/search.ts` (EPIC-8 S1, 2026-07-02):** the pure global-search spine over the Core graph. `searchNodes(nodes,query,limit=50)`
    → ranked `SearchHit[]` (`{node,score,field,snippet}`); `scoreNode(node,terms)` (AND semantics — every term must
    match title/type/body or the node is dropped; title-prefix 12≫word-boundary 9≫substring 6≫type 4/2≫body 2, +20/+10
    whole-query title bonus, recency tie-break); `nodeBodyText` (shallow string/number/bool `data` values, lowercased);
    `queryTerms`; `groupHitsByApp` → `AppHitGroup[]` ordered by best hit. No React/store — `src/apps/search/Search.tsx`
    feeds it `useGraph` nodes. `search.test.ts` (13). **Add filters/richer fields HERE, not in the component.**
    **Corpus caveat:** only what's mirrored into `empire-core-graph` is searchable; central-sync types (note/learning/
    message) reflect their real stores (safe in prod, PRUNED to empty in a bare QA seed — see the sync.ts prune trap).
  - `src/components/ui/NodeActions.tsx` — `<NodeActions type sourceId/>` ⚡ "Send to…" menu.
  - **Focus + command palette (S4, 2026-06-22):** `src/lib/core/focus.ts` — `useFocus` store
    (`focusedId`), pure `focusIdForEvent(event)` (NODE_CREATED/UPDATED/INTENT_RUN→nodeId,
    NODES_LINKED→fromId), and `startFocusTracking()` (called once in `main.tsx`) which subscribes
    `onAny` to keep `focusedId` = the LAST node touched (clears on that node's NODE_DELETED).
    `src/components/CommandPalette.tsx` — ⌘/Ctrl-K `gp` modal (self-contained: own open state +
    global keydown; rendered once in `Desktop.tsx` as Layer 7). Resolves the focused node from
    the graph, lists "Open in <app>" + `intentsFor(node)`, runs via `runIntent`+toast (mirrors
    NodeActions). Network's inspector `setFocus`es the selected app's newest node
    (`Network.tsx` effect on `[selected]`), so ⌘K after a click aims at something real.
  - **Inbox / Today task view (S5, 2026-06-22):** `src/lib/core/tasks.ts` — pure selectors
    `taskNodes(nodes)` / `partitionTasks(nodes)→{open,done}` / `isTaskDone(n)` (a task is done iff
    `data.done===true`; sorted newest-first by `meta.created` so a toggle doesn't reorder the list).
    Unit-tested in `tasks.test.ts` (4 tests). `src/apps/inbox/Inbox.tsx` — the 27th app (registry id
    `inbox`, `appComponents.tsx`); subscribes `useGraph(s=>s.nodes)`, renders open/done task rows
    with a checkbox that flips `data.done` via `updateNode(id,{data:{...n.data,done:!done}})`, a
    source-app chip (icon+name from `registry`), and `<NodeActions nodeId={n.id}/>`. **`NodeActions`
    now takes an optional `nodeId`** (all three props optional) to target graph-only nodes that have
    no store `sourceId` — tasks created by `make-task` carry only `data.done`/`data.from`. The only
    intent that `accepts` a `task` is `make-note-from` (so the ⚡ bar offers "Make Note from this").
  - **HANDOFF receiver rail (S1, 2026-06-22):** `src/lib/useInboundHandoff.ts` —
    `useInboundHandoff<T>(sessionKey)` reads the `empire-*-clipboard` payload once
    on mount, consumes the key, returns `{payload, source, dismiss}`.
    `src/components/ui/ProvenanceChip.tsx` — `<ProvenanceChip from onDismiss/>`
    glass pill in the source app's registry accent. Used by Editor / TokenCounter /
    PromptGenerator / AIChat. **To add a new receiver:** `const inbound =
    useInboundHandoff<{...}>('empire-x-clipboard')`, preload in a `[inbound.payload]`
    effect, render `{inbound.source && <ProvenanceChip from={inbound.source}
    onDismiss={inbound.dismiss}/>}`.
  - **Emit-onward menu (S6b, 2026-06-23):** `src/components/ui/SendResultMenu.tsx` —
    `<SendResultMenu source text title? actions? label?/>`, the *sender* mirror of the receiver rail.
    A glass `gp` dropdown (styled like `NodeActions`) whose items run
    `CROSS_APP_ACTIONS[key].execute({text,title,source})` (that executor already `handoff(...)`s → an
    arc lights). `ACTION_TARGET` maps each key→target app id and filters out the source (no
    self-handoff); `DEFAULT_ACTIONS` = Notes/PromptGen/AIChat/TokenCounter/Editor **+ Calendar/Goals/
    Messages (S6c)**. Disabled when `!text.trim()`. **Reuse for any future sink** — pass `source` +
    live text. Hover tints MUST stay
    `color-mix(in srgb, var(--signal) N%, transparent)` (raw `rgba(...)` regresses token-violations
    even inside JS strings — see Tried & rejected). Wired into Editor / TokenCounter / AIChat.
- **Cross-app handoffs:** `src/lib/appActions.ts` — `CROSS_APP_ACTIONS` executors; the
  `handoff(fromId,toId,label)` helper emits `HANDOFF` before navigating. Receivers read
  `sessionStorage` keys (`empire-editor-clipboard`, `-token-clipboard`, `-prompt-clipboard`,
  `-ai-clipboard`).
- **The Network app:** `src/apps/network/Network.tsx` — renders CoreNodes as satellites,
  consumes `HANDOFF` for directed app→app arcs (`flowForEvent`). **S3 (2026-06-22):** a
  single canvas click now **selects** a node (`onClick` → `setSelected(layout[i].app)`,
  empty space clears) and opens an **inspector** panel; the inspector's "⚡ Open" button is
  what launches the app now. Panels subscribe reactively via `useGraph(s=>s.nodes)` +
  memoized `appAdjacency`/`entitiesByApp`; the canvas render loop still reads the graph
  imperatively (animation unaffected — the effect does NOT depend on `selected`).
  **EPIC-6 S2 (2026-07-02):** the inspector gained a durable `Provenance · all-time` section (Fed by/Feeds via
  `fedBy`/`feeds`; `provRow`/`rowStyle` live inside the inspector IIFE), and the bottom-left ticker was wrapped in a
  column container with a persistent **Memory panel** above it (`recentEdges(provEdges,12)`, scrollable, reads the
  store so it survives reload). `provEdges = useProvenance(s => s.edges)` is a reactive sub next to `graphNodes`.
  - **`src/apps/network/adjacency.ts`** — pure seam: `appAdjacency(nodes): Record<app,{out,in}>`
    (owner→owner from node links; drops self-edges, owners not in registry, dangling links)
    and `entitiesByApp(nodes): Record<app, CoreNode[]>` (grouped, newest first). Unit-tested
    in `adjacency.test.ts`.
  - **`src/apps/network/nodeColors.ts`** — the ONE source of node-type colour:
    `TYPE_RGB` (triplets), `typeRgb(type)` (hashed fallback), and **`rgbCss(triplet, alpha?)`**
    which builds a CSS colour from a constant so reusing canonical triplets costs **zero**
    token-metric violations. Canvas, legend and inspector all import from here so they can't drift.
    **EPIC-2 S4:** also exports the canvas accent triplets `SIGNAL`/`ION`/`PLASMA`/`VOID` (bare `"r,g,b"`);
    `Network.tsx` now assembles **every** canvas fill via `rgbCss(...)` (0 literal `rgba(`/hex). `nodeColors.test.ts`
    pins these.
- **Registry / shell:** `src/lib/registry.ts` (**25 apps** post-redesign — `ai-agent`+`hermes-cc` deleted,
  `ai-chat`→**Cakra**), `src/lib/appComponents.tsx` (route→component map), `src/components/Desktop.tsx` (shell).
  **App identity icons** now resolve from the bespoke alien SVG set `src/design-system/icons/` via `getAppIcon()`.
  **Split 2026-06-30 (react-refresh fix):** the glyph *components* live in `icons/glyphs.tsx` (pure component module),
  the `alienIcons` map + `getAppIcon` resolver live in the `icons/index.ts` barrel (no component export). Import path
  unchanged. **Trap:** never add a non-component export (object/function) to `glyphs.tsx` or a component export to
  `index.ts` — `react-refresh/only-export-components` (`error`, now CI-gated) fires when a file mixes the two. Same
  split precedent as `network/nodeColors.ts`.
- **Design system:** `src/design-system/colors_and_type.css` (canonical **JondriDev Earth-from-Space**
  palette — re-skinned 2026-06-28, was XENO; the `:root`/theme CSS custom props), `src/design-system.css`
  (legacy-token *bridge*, re-valued onto the DS tokens — edit here to restyle all apps),
  `src/window-manager.css`, `src/index.css`.
  - **`src/design-system/tokens.ts` (EPIC-2 S1, 2026-06-23):** the TS-side single source of palette truth,
    mirroring the CSS custom props. **`cssVar('signal')`→`'var(--signal)'`** (themeable, preferred) and
    **`tint('signal',12)`→`'color-mix(in srgb, var(--signal) 12%, transparent)'`** (translucent tint with NO
    raw `rgba(` → no metric violation; rounds+clamps pct). `PALETTE` holds the raw hex only for JS consumers
    that can't resolve a CSS var. **This is the rail for the EPIC-2 sweep** — import these into any app file
    and replace hex/rgba inline styles. Token names: signal/aurora/plasma/ion/ember/xenon/void/abyss,
    text/text2/text3, c-success/c-warn/c-danger/c-info. (Distinct from `network/nodeColors.ts`'s `rgbCss`,
    which builds colours from constant *triplets* for the canvas.)
    - **`CATEGORICAL: string[]` (EPIC-2 S6, 2026-06-28):** the canonical "N-distinct-series" rail — 8 distinct-hex
      `var(--…)` accents (ion/signal/ember/plasma/aurora/c-warn/c-danger/xenon). Index `CATEGORICAL[i % len]` for any
      decorative categorical colour (chart series, kanban tags, form field-types). Use this instead of a hardcoded hex
      array; reserve `DS_INFRA` exemptions for genuine brand/content identity data. Tested in `tokens.test.ts`.
- **AI routing:** `src/lib/ai.ts` → `src/lib/apiBase.ts` (`aiApiUrl()`); live site routes
  Cakra to the Supabase proxy, dev stays same-origin.
- **Durable media store (EPIC-3 S2, 2026-06-28):** `src/lib/mediaStore.ts` — the rail for any app that
  holds user-uploaded `Blob`s that must survive a reload. **IDB glue:** `putMedia(id,blob)→bool`,
  `getMedia(id)→Blob|null`, `deleteMedia(id)`, `allMediaIds()`, `loadMediaUrls(ids)→Map<id,url>` (DB
  `empire-media`, store `blobs`; every op is a tolerant no-op when IndexedDB is absent — jsdom/private mode).
  **Pure transforms (the tested part — `mediaStore.test.ts`, 11 cases):** `toStorableMeta(items)` strips the
  volatile `src` + drops `ephemeral` (what you write to localStorage), `rehydrateMedia(meta, urlForId)` mints
  fresh URLs and **drops ghosts** (the bug fix), `shouldPersistBlob(size)` enforces the 75 MB cap. Consumed by
  `Music.tsx` + `Video.tsx` + **`Photos.tsx` (EPIC-3 S3, 2026-06-29)**. jsdom has no IDB → keep the glue
  thin/untested, test only the transforms. **Reuse this exact rail for any future blob-holding app** —
  `Photos.tsx` is the most recent verbatim port (`url`→`src`, `hydratedRef` gate, ephemeral "session" chip).

- **PWA offline guard + precache audit (EPIC-4 S1, 2026-06-29):**
  - `vite.config.ts:18-90` — the **`vite-plugin-pwa`** (`VitePWA`) config: Workbox `generateSW`,
    `globPatterns: ['**/*.{js,css,html,svg,png,ico,woff,woff2,json}']` + `maximumFileSizeToCacheInBytes: 5 MB`
    (this is why the precache has no gap — it catches every chunk under 5 MB, incl. Maps' 160 KB). `manifest`
    uses relative `start_url:'.'`/`scope:'.'`; `navigateFallback: base + 'index.html'`. The build prints
    `precache N entries`.
  - `scripts/precacheAudit.mjs` — **pure** seam: `extractPrecacheUrls(swText)` (regex-pulls the inlined
    `{url,revision}` manifest out of `dist/sw.js`) + `auditPrecache(swText, assetFileNames)` →
    `{precacheCount, jsChunks, cssChunks, missing[], ok}`. `precacheCount` = raw manifest entries (matches the
    build log's "N entries"; ~8 icons appear twice via `includeAssets` + `globPatterns`); membership check
    dedupes. Unit-tested in `scripts/precacheAudit.test.mjs` (6 cases).
  - `scripts/qa-offline.mjs` — the **cold-offline boot guard**. Self-contained: own `node:http` static server
    for `dist/` (SPA fallback → index.html; `Service-Worker-Allowed:/` on sw.js) on port 3101 + own browser
    (reuses the `launchBrowser()` Chromium recipe). Warm-loads `/` → waits for the SW to be `active` + controlling
    → **`context.setOffline(true)`** → asserts `/` (needs `.empire-desktop`) + 4 lazy routes render from precache.
    Writes `docs/screenshots/latest/OFFLINE.md` + `/tmp/qa-offline.json`; exits non-zero on failure. **Run
    standalone** `node scripts/qa-offline.mjs` (needs a fresh `npm run build` + the playwright symlink). Wired into
    `qa-smoke.mjs` (spawned after smoke, non-fatal, folded into REPORT.md's "Offline-boot guard" section).
  - **vitest `include` now also matches `scripts/**/*.{test,spec}.mjs`** (`vitest.config.ts:10`) so QA-tooling
    logic can be unit-pinned alongside the app tests. (metrics.mjs still counts only `src/` tests — `scripts/`
    tests don't move the test-cases metric.)

- **PWA base-path / install-flow audit (EPIC-4 S3, 2026-06-29):**
  - `vite.config.ts:11` — `const base = process.env.EMPIRE_BASE || '/'`. Manifest is **base-agnostic**:
    `start_url:'.'`/`scope:'.'` (relative → resolve vs the manifest's own URL, adapt to any base) and now
    **`id:'empire'`** (was `'/'`; `id` resolves vs `start_url`'s ORIGIN with its path ignored — per MDN — so a
    root id collides on a shared origin like `github.io`; a relative path segment gives one stable
    `<origin>/empire` identity for every deploy base). Workbox `navigateFallback: base + 'index.html'`.
  - **Installability auditor (EPIC-4 S4, 2026-06-29):** `auditInstallability(manifest)` + `maxIconSize(sizes)` in
    `scripts/pwaBaseAudit.mjs` — PURE manifest-only check of the browser install criteria (name+short_name; a ≥192
    AND a ≥512 `any`-purpose icon; a `maskable` icon; standalone-ish `display` incl. via `display_override`;
    `start_url`; `background_color`+`theme_color`). Returns `{criteria{}, missing[], ok}`. `maxIconSize('any')` →
    `Infinity` (scalable SVG); a missing `purpose` defaults to `'any'`. **`auditPwaBase` now also runs it** (adds a
    `not installable — missing: …` issue) and `check-pwa-base.mjs` prints it + tables it in PWA-BASE.md. Tested by
    the +12 cases in `pwaBaseAudit.test.mjs`. **The fixture there (`FULL_MANIFEST`) mirrors the real `vite.config.ts`
    manifest** — if you change the manifest's icons/colors/display, update that fixture too.
  - `scripts/pwaBaseAudit.mjs` — **pure** seam (text + base in → report out, no fs/browser):
    `auditPwaBase({html, swText, registerSwText, manifestText, base})` aggregates `auditHtmlBase` (every local
    `<script src>`/`<link href>` prefixed with base + manifest linked), `auditSwBase` (Workbox inlines
    `createHandlerBoundToURL("<base>index.html")` — regex-pull + compare), `auditRegisterSw`
    (`register('<base>sw.js',{scope:'<base>'})`), `auditManifest` (start_url/scope relative + id a stable
    non-root same-origin path). Helpers `extractHtmlAssetUrls`, `normalizeBase`. Unit-tested in
    `scripts/pwaBaseAudit.test.mjs` (17 cases).
  - `scripts/check-pwa-base.mjs` — the **runner**. `spawnSync('npx', ['vite','build','--base=<BASE>',
    '--outDir=dist-pwa-base-check','--emptyOutDir'])` (BASE = `PWA_CHECK_BASE` || `/empire/`), reads the emitted
    `index.html`/`sw.js`/`registerSW.js`/`manifest.webmanifest`, runs `auditPwaBase`, writes
    `docs/screenshots/latest/PWA-BASE.md` + `/tmp/pwa-base.json`, **rm's the throwaway outDir** (gitignored), exits
    non-zero on any mismatch. **Run standalone** `node scripts/check-pwa-base.mjs` (does its own build — needs no
    pre-existing dist, never touches the real `dist/`). NOT wired into `qa-smoke.mjs` (it does a full vite build;
    avoid doubling smoke's build time) — QA can run it on demand; the pure-helper tests give the ongoing guard.

## ⚠️ Invariants & traps (do NOT relearn these the hard way)

- **Offline PWA testing — use `context.setOffline(true)`, NOT `page.route('**',abort)`:** `setOffline` fails real
  network egress while Cache Storage still serves, so a precached chunk loads and a non-precached one falls through
  to a dead network (the render breaks) — the faithful "cold boot" signal. `page.route` interception is murkier with
  a controlling service worker (SW-served responses never hit the route). Also: **warm-load + wait for the SW to be
  `active` AND `navigator.serviceWorker.controller` set before going offline** — the precache only exists once the
  SW's install (which runs `precacheAndRoute`) completes; cut the network too early and you test an empty cache.

- **Blank-dark trap:** a `*/` sequence *inside* a CSS doc-comment in `design-system.css`
  (e.g. `--text*/`) closes the comment early → brace mismatch nests every `.empire-*`
  rule under `@media(max-width:640px){.hide-sm…}` → desktop renders unstyled **despite a
  green build**. Always **space out the slashes** in comments. Verify without a browser:
  `grep -o '/\*'` count == `grep -o '\*/'` count, and built `dist/assets/index-*.css` has a
  **top-level `.empire-desktop{position:fixed}`** with **zero `.hide-sm .empire-desktop`**.
- **Blob-URL persistence trap (Music/Video — FIXED EPIC-3 S2, reuse the rail for Photos S3):**
  `URL.createObjectURL(file)` returns a *session-scoped* URL that is **invalid after a reload** — never
  round-trip a blob URL through localStorage and expect it to play. **The rail (`src/lib/mediaStore.ts`):**
  store the real `Blob` in IndexedDB (`putMedia(id,blob)`), persist **metadata only** via `toStorableMeta(items)`
  (strips `src` + drops `ephemeral`), and on mount `loadMediaUrls(ids)` → `rehydrateMedia(meta, urlForId)` to
  mint fresh object URLs and **drop any item whose blob is gone** (no ghost rows). **Gate the persist effect
  behind a `hydratedRef`** so the initial empty render doesn't clobber the saved library before the async
  rehydrate finishes (race — both Music & Video do this). Oversized blobs (`!shouldPersistBlob(size)`) stay
  session-only (`ephemeral`, excluded from localStorage). Photos S3 should reuse this exact rail.
- **Clock persists via a pure logic module (EPIC-3 S1):** `src/apps/clock/clockLogic.ts` owns the maths +
  (de)serialization (`deserializeClockState` is tolerant — bad JSON / null / partial / corrupt all fall
  back field-by-field, so adding a field never wipes saved alarms). The component lazy-loads from
  `empire-clock-state` via a `useMemo(()=>deserialize(safeGet(KEY)),[])` initializer (no load-effect flash)
  and persists in a `[alarms, worldClocks, is24Hour]` effect. Test the *pure module*, not the component
  (localStorage is an inert `vi.fn()` mock in `src/test/setup.ts`). Pattern to reuse for any instrument that
  needs to survive a reload.
- **Calendar owns its own storage:** events live in `empire-calendar-events` (NOT the central
  store) and self-mirror via `mirrorCollection()` in a `[events]` effect. **Never add an
  `event` syncer to the central list** — it would delete Calendar's nodes.
- **Alpha-append trap (EPIC-2 sweep):** the idiom `` background: `${color}18` `` (append a 2-hex alpha
  to a colour) **silently breaks** when you swap `color` from a hex to a CSS var — `var(--ion)18` is
  invalid CSS and renders nothing. When de-hexing a file that uses this pattern, convert those sites to
  `` `color-mix(in srgb, ${color} N%, transparent)` `` (0x18≈9%, 0x14≈8%, 0x88≈53%). Leave `${app.color}NN`
  alone while `registry.ts` still supplies a real hex there (valid, and not a violation in *that* file).
- **An app joins the organism in ~3 lines:** `mirrorCollection(type, app, items, {id,title,data})`
  in a `useEffect` + `<NodeActions type="<type>" sourceId={item.id}/>` in each row.
- **Graph is a mirror, not the source of truth (yet):** apps keep their own store/localStorage;
  the graph reflects them. `make-note-from`/`add-to-learning` create graph-only nodes — they do
  **not** write back into the Notes/Learning stores yet.
- **Sandbox quirks:** branch deletion via the cloud git proxy returns **HTTP 403** (merged heads
  linger — harmless). Headless **Chromium CDN download 403s**; use the recipe below.
- **Test setup stubs storage:** `src/test/setup.ts` replaces `window.sessionStorage`/
  `localStorage` with inert `vi.fn()`s (no real store). Any test exercising a storage
  round-trip must `Object.defineProperty(window,'sessionStorage',{value: <Map-backed shim>})`
  in `beforeEach` (see `useInboundHandoff.test.ts`). Also: `act` imports from
  `@testing-library/react`, **not** `vitest`.
- **StrictMode is ON in prod** (`src/main.tsx`). A "read sessionStorage once + removeItem"
  mount effect is safe (dev double-invoke keeps the state set on the first pass; the second
  finds an empty key and no-ops), but never rely on the key surviving a second read.

## 🖥️ QA headless-render recipe (known-good)

- Use the pre-installed browser: Playwright `chromium.launch({ executablePath: '/opt/pw-browsers/chromium-1194/chrome-linux/chrome' })`
  (adjust the version dir if it changed). **Fallback:** `@sparticuz/chromium`. Do **not** rely on
  `cdn.playwright.dev` (403). Serve the built app on `http://localhost:3001` before rendering.
- `scripts/qa-smoke.mjs` must include the **shell-is-styled assertion** (see blank-dark trap) so a
  green-but-blank build can't pass.

## 🧪 Tried & rejected (don't repeat dead ends)

- **`export const TYPE_RGB` from `Network.tsx` → rejected:** eslint
  `react-refresh/only-export-components` fails (a component file may export only
  components). **Do Z:** put shared constants/helpers in a sibling module
  (`nodeColors.ts`) and import them — that's why `TYPE_RGB`/`typeRgb`/`rgbCss` live there.
- **Token-metric trap (NEW):** `scripts/metrics.mjs` greps raw text for `\brgba?\(`
  and `#hex` — **including comments**. So a literal `rgb(` *in a code comment* counts
  as a violation. To reuse a token triplet as a CSS colour without a violation, use
  `rgbCss(triplet, alpha?)` from `nodeColors.ts` (assembles the string from a constant,
  no literal `rgb(`), and never write `rgb(`/`rgba(` in prose. Reusing this helped S3
  *lower* the metric 503→501 (the old ticker swatches used raw `rgb(${s.rgb})`).

## 📊 Last QA confirmation (2026-06-30, green main `f9ec888` — confirms the security-harden + Files-graph-mirror commits; surfaced pre-existing eslint debt)

- **Routes rendering clean: 26/26 ✅** (27/27 incl. desktop). Green main `f9ec888` = 2 commits past last QA `c51f79f`:
  `d866a7a` (Files whole-state graph-mirror) + `f9ec888` (security harden local backend/worker + Calendar month fix +
  offline fonts + leak fixes). All 27 routes render with **0 uncaught JS**; vitest **216/216** (25 files, +8 from
  `filesGraph.test.ts`); build 🟢. SHELL-IS-STYLED ✅ + REGISTRY-COVERAGE ✅ bidirectional (26 apps) + INBOUND-LANDS
  **3/3 ✅** + MEDIA-PERSISTS **3/3 ✅** + OFFLINE-BOOT **5/5 ✅** (PRECACHE **78 entries** / 43 JS + 3 CSS, NO GAP).
- **✅ RESOLVED (Builder 2026-06-30) — eslint back to green + CI-gated.** The flagged 2 errors in
  `icons/index.tsx:274,306` (`react-refresh/only-export-components`) + 6 unused-disable warnings in reader are FIXED:
  the icons module was split (`glyphs.tsx` components / `index.ts` barrel) and the 6 dead directives deleted →
  `npx eslint .` exits 0 with **zero problems**. **`verify.yml` now runs `npx eslint .`** (errors fail CI red), so this
  can't silently rot again. **Lesson kept: actually RUN `npx eslint .` each QA — and now CI does too.**
- **★ Epic-acceptance:** **No `▶ ACTIVE` epic** (EPIC-5 CLOSED; Strategist must promote next). EPIC-5's lock re-held:
  `node scripts/metrics.mjs --assert-zero` exits **0** (`tokenViolations=0, offSystemUtilities=0`) across both new
  commits. No contradiction; no runtime regression.
- **Visually verified:** windowless full-screen launcher shell (Earth-from-Space palette, alien icons, bottom dock);
  **Calendar month fix CONFIRMED** — renders **June 2026** with the 30th highlighted on **Tuesday** (June 30 2026 IS a
  Tuesday ✅); **Maps** real Leaflet container w/ OSM/CARTO attribution (only tiles grey — egress-blocked, net:8, NOT a bug).
- **Metric deltas vs `c51f79f`:** apps 26 (±0), vitest 208→216 (+8, `filesGraph.test.ts`), files 24→25 (+1),
  token-violations 0 (±0), off-system 0 (±0, locked), bundle gz 691.3→691.4 (+0.1), precache 70→78 (+8).
- `latest/` holds only: `desktop.png` + 26 `app-<id>.png` + REPORT.md/OFFLINE.md/PWA-BASE.md.

### Prior QA confirmation (2026-06-29, post-EPIC-4-S4 green main `d17f73a` — EPIC-4 fully DONE; offline-boots + base-path still LIVE; EPIC-3 CODE-COMPLETE)

- **Routes rendering clean: 25/25 ✅** (26/26 incl. desktop). SHELL-IS-STYLED ✅ (top-level
  `.empire-desktop{…position:fixed…}`, 0 `.hide-sm .empire-desktop`) + REGISTRY-COVERAGE ✅ (bidirectional, all 25
  registry apps ↔ smoke list) + INBOUND-LANDS **3/3 ✅** (calendar←editor, goals←notes, messages←ai-chat each
  show "Received from …" chip + prefilled control off the live render) + **MEDIA-PERSISTS 3/3 ✅ (music + video +
  photos)**. build🟢 vitest **205/205 🟢** (23 files) eslint clean. **No runtime bugs found.** Visually verified:
  Earth-from-Space palette + alien icons + Cakra (desktop.png); Maps renders the real Leaflet
  container w/ zoom + OSM/CARTO attribution (only tiles grey — egress-blocked, env-expected).
- **★ EPIC-4 S4 ACCEPTANCE CONFIRMED — manifest installability (EPIC-4 CLOSE).** S4 (`d17f73a`) is the only code commit
  since the last QA (`14466a8`, for S3 `1b5e695`). `node scripts/check-pwa-base.mjs` → **`installable = ✅ (4 icons)`**
  — manifest passes name+short_name, a ≥192 AND a ≥512 `any`-purpose icon, a maskable icon, standalone display,
  start_url, background_color+theme_color (`auditInstallability` in `pwaBaseAudit.mjs`; vitest +12 → 205). The
  deterministic, offline-checkable realization of *Lighthouse-PWA ≥ 90*. **EPIC-4 (PWA completion) is now fully DONE:
  offline ✅ + base ✅ + installable ✅.** Base-path/install-flow (S3) re-confirmed ✅ under `--base=/empire/`.
- **EPIC-4 S1 `offline-boots` guard still PASSES (re-confirmed).** `scripts/qa-offline.mjs` warm-loaded → `setOffline(true)`
  blocked ALL network → **5/5 routes booted cold-offline** (`/`, `/app/clock`, `/app/maps`, `/app/network`,
  `/app/photos`) purely from precache. **PRECACHE-AUDIT: 63 entries (37 JS + 2 CSS), NO GAP ✅** (S2 no-op held).
- **Apps fully wired BOTH-ways: 9/9 entity-apps-with-inbound — ✅ EPIC-1 TARGET (held, EPIC-1 DONE).**
  Both-ways: `prompt-generator`, notes, learning-tracker, editor, token-counter, ai-chat, calendar, goals,
  messages. Intentionally emit-only (by design): files, photos, datacenter + tool apps via `NodeActions`.
  Re-verified live this run by the smoke harness's INBOUND-LANDS guard (3/3 receivers chip+prefill).
- **Epic-acceptance this run: EPIC-4 S4 CONFIRMED → EPIC-4 fully DONE; S1 offline-boots + S3 base-path re-confirmed; EPIC-3 CODE-COMPLETE (function 8/8 held).**
  Since the last QA (`14466a8`, for S3 `1b5e695`) one code commit landed: **`d17f73a` EPIC-4 S4** (added
  `auditInstallability(manifest)` + `maxIconSize` to `pwaBaseAudit.mjs`, surfaced via `check-pwa-base.mjs` +
  PWA-BASE.md Installability table; `pwaBaseAudit.test.mjs` 17→29 cases). Acceptance `node scripts/check-pwa-base.mjs`
  → **`installable = ✅ (4 icons)`**. **No contradiction; no runtime bug.**
  **▶ NEXT STAGE = none pre-decomposed** — EPIC-5 (Android APK validation) QUEUED, needs the Strategist to promote +
  seed stages. If no `▶ ACTIVE` epic, builder takes the topmost ROADMAP NOW (or begins chipping the 1076 off-system
  Tailwind utilities, the measured open front) and flags EPICS needs the Strategist.
- **Auto metrics vs last QA snapshot `1b5e695`:** test cases **193→205 vitest (+12)** (`pwaBaseAudit.test.mjs`
  installability cases), test files **23 (±0; metrics.mjs still 21, `src/`-only)**, bundle gz
  **292.5 (±0)**, off-system utilities **1076 (±0)**, apps **25 (±0)**, token-violations **0 (±0)**.
- **`latest/` holds only:** current `desktop.png` + 25 `app-<id>.png` + `REPORT.md` (no dated/per-stage PNGs).
- **Env-expected net noise (not bugs):** weather→Open-Meteo geocoding + Geolocation blocked, maps→CARTO/OSM
  dark-tile PNGs blocked (Leaflet container + attribution still render), files `/api/files?path=/storage/emulated/0`
  →500 (Android-only path).
- QA harness note: project has **no `playwright` dep**; it's global at `/opt/node22/lib/node_modules`.
  The run symlinks it into `node_modules/` (env-only, not committed). Pre-installed Chromium at
  `/opt/pw-browsers/chromium-1194`. `scripts/qa-smoke.mjs` `launchBrowser()` auto-globs the version dir.

## 📌 Open follow-ups discovered (promote into EPICS.md stages)

- ~~DataCenter `dataset` nodes only carry a row count for the *active* table.~~ **→ STALE/RESOLVED (2026-06-30):
  `DataCenter.tsx:57` already mirrors `Object.keys(store)` — every table with its own `rows` count. The note
  predated the redesign; no change needed.**
- ~~Files `file` nodes only reflect the *current* directory (reconcile drops others on navigate).~~ **→ FIXED
  2026-06-30: `Files.tsx` now accumulates the **session union** of files across every directory visited (new pure
  `src/apps/files/filesGraph.ts` + ref) and mirrors the whole union, so navigating ADDS to the graph instead of
  pruning prior folders. Bounded to one session; self-cleans on reload.**
- **organism-completeness-II (investigated 2026-06-30 — NOT broken, polish only):** the Cakra merge kept the
  standalone `editor`/`token-counter`/`prompt-generator` components in `appComponents.tsx` and marked them
  `hidden + aliasOf:{appId:'ai-chat',tab}` in `registry.ts`. Two open-paths exist & BOTH work: (1) the desktop
  launcher/CommandPalette/Network use `openAppById` (`windowStore.ts:105-116`) which **resolves the alias** → opens
  Cakra + `setCakraTab`; (2) `appActions` handoffs use `window.open('/app/editor','_self')` → `App.tsx` `/app/:appId`
  → `AppShell` (`dashboard/AppShell.tsx`, does NOT resolve aliasOf) → renders the **standalone** Editor, which still
  has its `useInboundHandoff` receiver, so the **handoff lands**. **The remaining (optional) win:** make `AppShell` (or
  `appActions`) resolve `aliasOf` so deep-links/handoffs land on the merged **Cakra tab** instead of the orphaned
  standalone app — a coherence/consistency change, **needs on-device visual confirmation** (not a bug; nothing is
  dead). `SendResultMenu` `ACTION_TARGET`/`DEFAULT_ACTIONS` reference ids that all still resolve — no dead targets.
- ~~Photos `photo` nodes carry no thumbnail (object URLs are revoked on delete).~~ **→ EPIC-3 S3 SHIPPED
  2026-06-29: Photos now uses the `mediaStore` IDB rail so the library survives a reload (the blob-URL bug is
  fixed). `photo` nodes still carry name/size/tags only (not the URL) — by design, URLs are session-scoped.**
