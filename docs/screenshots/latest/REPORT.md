# Empire QA — Visual + Smoke Report

**Generated:** 2026-06-29T13:06:09.684Z

**Result:** 26/26 rendered without crash, 0 failed.

> **PASS** = the app rendered with no uncaught JS exception / error boundary / blank screen.
> Network & console noise (failed external CDN fetches, backend API calls needing auth) is
> listed separately — expected in the offline cloud sandbox and **not** a render failure.

## Inbound-lands guard (organism emit↔receive loop)

Each entity receiver was seeded with a cross-app payload + reloaded; PASS = a "Received from <source>" chip rendered AND a control was prefilled.

| Receiver | From | Chip | Prefilled | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| calendar | editor | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Media-persists guard (EPIC-3 S2/S3 — IndexedDB blob roundtrip)

Each media app's real file `<input>` was driven with a small blob, then the page was reloaded; PASS = the item appeared after add AND survived the reload (rehydrated from IndexedDB, not dropped as a ghost). This exercises the S2 acceptance that jsdom cannot (no IndexedDB).

| App | Added | Survived reload | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| music | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| video | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| photos | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Offline-boot guard (EPIC-4 S1 — cold boot from SW precache)

The built app was served, warm-loaded so the service worker precached, then ALL network was blocked (`setOffline`); each route below was navigated cold and must render purely from the precache. The precache audit cross-checks the SW manifest against every emitted chunk.

**Precache:** 63 manifest entries; 37 JS + 2 CSS chunks emitted — ✅ no gap (all chunks precached).

| Route | Renders offline |
|---|---|
| / | ✅ |
| /app/clock | ✅ |
| /app/maps | ✅ |
| /app/network | ✅ |
| /app/photos | ✅ |

**Cold-offline boot: 5/5 ✅**
