## QA verdict — green main `57262e8` · EPIC-11 **S2 + S3 done-confirmed** + Cakra **Problem Solver** renders clean · no runtime bug

**No runtime regression found.** First independent QA since three commits landed on top of the last QA
(`ca10d0a` = EPIC-11 S1 confirm): **EPIC-11 S2** (`20bc957`, type→0), **EPIC-11 S3** (`4f79ded`, radii→0),
and the **Cakra Problem Solver** (`57262e8`, new `solver` route + 32-problem world catalog + 4-stage engine).
Build 🟢 · vitest **360/360** (38 files) · eslint clean (build) · `metrics.mjs --assert-zero` exit 0.

**Active-epic acceptance (EPIC-11 · design-system conformance II — S2 reduce TYPE, S3 reduce RADII):**
✅ **BOTH CONFIRMED — the acceptance metric moved.** `node scripts/metrics.mjs` reproduces **Off-system style
`2 (r0/t0/m2)`** exactly on a fresh checkout: the **type** sub-count is **0** (S2 drove t42→0) and the **radii**
sub-count is **0** (S3 drove r12→0). The metric fell **56 → 14 → 2** across the two stages exactly as ratified;
only the **motion** sub-count (m2) remains, and the two surviving offenders are precisely the S4 targets —
`ArtifactGallery.tsx` (`ease-out`) and `Calculator.tsx` (`ease-in-out` pulse). The two colour audits stay 0 and
`offSystemStyle` is (correctly) still NOT locked into `--assert-zero` — it locks at 0 in S4. **S2 + S3 are
done-confirmed; S4 (motion m2→0 + LOCK) is the only remaining stage → EPIC-11 CODE-COMPLETE after S4.**

**Cakra Problem Solver (new since last QA):** ✅ renders clean at `/app/solver` (deep-link standalone panel) —
header "Problem Solver · AI", `0 open · 0 solved · today 0/100 AI calls`, the **Import world catalog (32)**
button, an "Add a problem to solve…" intake, the `daily budget 100` control + **Solve everything** action, and
the green-puzzle empty state ("The world has problems"). Visually confirmed (`app-solver.png`). Registered as a
**hidden alias** (`solver` → `ai-chat` tab), so it correctly does NOT appear as its own launcher tile; the smoke
list ↔ registry cross-check passes at **29 apps** and its 3 unit-test files (`engine`/`catalog`/`queue`) run green.

**Metric deltas vs the last QA snapshot (`ca10d0a`, EPIC-11 S1 — apps 28 · offSystemStyle 56 · vitest 334 · bundle 705.4):**

| Metric | Value | Δ vs S1 snapshot |
|---|---|---|
| Apps / routes | 29 | **+1** (the `solver` alias route) |
| Test cases (static · vitest) | 302 · **360** | +26 static / +26 vitest (solver `engine`/`catalog`/`queue`; S2/S3 kept green) |
| Test files (static · vitest) | 35 · 38 | +3 (solver test files) |
| Token violations | 0 | ±0 |
| Off-system utilities | 0 | ±0 |
| **Off-system style** | **2 (r0/t0/m2)** | **−54** (type −42 [S2], radii −12 [S3]; only motion m2 left → S4) |
| Bundle gz (KB) | 718.9 | +13.5 (+12.6 Cakra solver lazy chunk [declared], +0.9 build-env gzip variance) |

**Every guard green:** SHELL-IS-STYLED ✅ · REGISTRY-COVERAGE 29 ✅ · 30/30 routes render clean (0 uncaught JS) ·
INBOUND 3/3 · MEDIA 3/3 · GRAPH-LEGIBLE 1/1 · GLOBAL-SEARCH 1/1 (`tagOnly`) · NODE-LINEAGE 1/1 (5 axes) ·
**TIMELINE 1/1 (all 6 axes — `ordered`+`grouped`+`flow`+`persisted`+`filtered`+`descendants`)** · HOME-ALIVE 1/1 ·
PROVENANCE-PERSISTS 3/3 · PROVENANCE-ENTITY 3/3 · OFFLINE-BOOT 5/5 · PRECACHE 85 no-gap. **Visually verified:**
`desktop.png` (the Bridge — "Good night", 4 live stat cards, the 25-tile launcher grid through Timeline) +
`app-solver.png` (the Problem Solver panel). Env-expected noise only (blocked CDN tiles on Maps net:8, Open-Meteo
tunnel-fail on Weather, `/api/files` HTTP 500) — **not** render failures.

> **Note (observed vs. builder-stated test count):** I observe **vitest 360/360 (38 files)** on a clean checkout;
> the Cakra commit message stated `344/344 (37 files)`. The +16/+1 delta is a builder measurement-scope difference,
> not a defect — all 360 pass deterministically, green. Metrics static `testCases` reads **302** (src-only count).

---

> **PASS** = the app rendered with no uncaught JS exception / error boundary / blank screen.
> Network & console noise (failed external CDN fetches, backend API calls needing auth) is
> listed separately — expected in the offline cloud sandbox and **not** a render failure.

## Inbound-lands guard (organism emit↔receive loop)

Each entity receiver was seeded with a cross-app payload + reloaded; PASS = a "Received from <source>" chip rendered AND a control was prefilled.

| Receiver | From | Chip | Prefilled | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| calendar | editor | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| goals | notes | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| messages | ai-chat | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Media-persists guard (EPIC-3 S2/S3 — IndexedDB blob roundtrip)

Each media app's real file `<input>` was driven with a small blob, then the page was reloaded; PASS = the item appeared after add AND survived the reload (rehydrated from IndexedDB, not dropped as a ghost). This exercises the S2 acceptance that jsdom cannot (no IndexedDB).

| App | Added | Survived reload | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| music | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| video | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| photos | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Graph-legible guard (EPIC-6 S4 — Reader's books join the organism)

Reader's real file `<input>` was driven with a small `.txt` book, then the persisted Core graph (`empire-core-graph`) was inspected; PASS = a `book` node owned by `app==='reader'` appeared AND survived a reload (the re-mounted Reader re-mirrors its library). This closes the last graph-island — every collection-owning app is now graph-legible.

| Collection | Node created | Survived reload | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| reader/book | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

**GRAPH-LEGIBLE: 1/1 ✅**

## Global-search guard (EPIC-8 S1 + S2 — the organism becomes queryable)

The Core graph was seeded with entities sharing a rare term across TWO apps (a `book` in Reader, a `task` in Goals); after a reload (persist rehydrate) the term was typed into the Search field. PASS = BOTH entities surface, grouped under their own app sections — one lens querying every app's real entities at once. **S2 adds a tag-only match:** a third node carries the term `Tessellate` ONLY in `data.tags` (a string array) — it surfaces iff `nodeBodyText` now flattens array elements (the S2 corpus gap). The pure ranking spine (`searchNodes`) is unit-pinned in `search.test.ts`; this carries the graph→input→grouped-render roundtrip jsdom cannot.

| Query | Book hit | Task hit | Spans 2 apps | Tag-only hit | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Xenolith / Tessellate | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

**GLOBAL-SEARCH: 1/1 ✅**

## Node-lineage guard (node-level lineage — per-artifact ancestry is legible)

App-level provenance remembers which app fed which app; node-level lineage answers which ENTITY an exact artifact descended from. The core intents stamp `data.from = sourceNode.id` on every node they create, so the graph already holds a durable per-artifact ancestry edge. Two graph-survivable `task` nodes were seeded — a parent and a child whose `data.from` points at it — then reloaded so the persist store rehydrated; PASS = the Inbox child row renders a `<NodeLineage>` (`[data-node-lineage]`) carrying the parent entity's real title, AND it still resolves after a second reload (the `from` link is durable). **S2 extends the surface:** the same seeded ancestry must ALSO render on the Search result row (query "anomaly" → the child hit shows `[data-node-lineage=qa-lineage-parent]`), proving `<NodeLineage>` is now legible on every node-rendering view, not just the Inbox — the same drop-in surface also mounts on The Network inspector's per-entity list (visual/on-device). The pure walker `nodeLineageOf` is unit-pinned in `nodeLineage.test.ts`; this carries the graph→persist→rehydrate→render roundtrip jsdom cannot.

 **S3 makes it NAVIGABLE:** each ancestry hop is a real `[role="button"]` that climbs to the source entity (`openEntity` → open its owning app + set the gaze); the guard asserts the parent hop renders as a focusable control whose accessible name targets the parent entity, then clicks it (the window/focus change is unit-pinned in `NodeLineage.test.tsx` — on the /app/search route AppShell renders by URL, so in-app navigation isn't observable headless).

| Artifact | Lineage rendered | Parent title shown | Survived reload | Search surface | Hop clickable | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| task ← Chart the Xenobloom anomaly | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

**NODE-LINEAGE: 1/1 ✅**

## Timeline guard (EPIC-10 S1–S3 — the TEMPORAL lens: faceted, and read BOTH ways)

The Empire had three lenses over its one Core graph — Network (STRUCTURAL), Search (QUERY), Inbox (TASK) — but no way to see *when* it did things, even though every `CoreNode` stamps `meta.created` and every `ProvEdge` stamps `at`. The Timeline app merges every entity-birth + every app→app handoff into one newest-first, day-grouped stream via the pure `buildTimeline`/`groupByDay`/`dayKey` spine, now filtered by the pure `filterTimeline`/`timelineFacets` helpers (all unit-pinned in `timeline.test.ts`). Two graph-survivable `task` nodes (distinct `meta.created`, owned by two apps, the newer's `data.from` = the older) + one `empire-provenance` edge were seeded, then reloaded so BOTH persist stores rehydrated; PASS = the two entity rows render newest-`created` first (`ordered`), at least one `[data-timeline-day]` header renders (`grouped`), the seeded edge renders as a `[data-timeline-kind=flow]` row (`flow`), all of it still holds after a SECOND reload (`persisted`), the older entity's row surfaces a `<NodeDescendants>` (`[data-node-descendants=qa-tl-older]`) naming the newer child it spawned (`descendants`), and clicking the `goals` App chip narrows to ONLY the goals-owned entity — dropping the notes entity + the notes→goals flow (`filtered`). **S3** surfaces the long-dormant `childrenOf` walker so a moment reads BOTH ways — `↖ ancestry` (`<NodeLineage>`) and `→ spawned` (`<NodeDescendants>`), each hop a navigable `[role="button"]` (unit-pinned in `NodeDescendants.test.tsx`). This carries the graph+ledger→persist→rehydrate→ordered-render + faceted-narrow + descendants roundtrip jsdom cannot; the sticky day headers, relative labels + chip tints are the on-device visual.

| Ordered newest-first | Grouped by day | Flow row | Survived reload | Spawned-child shown | App-chip narrows | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

**TIMELINE: 1/1 ✅**

## Home-alive guard (The Bridge — the home screen is living telemetry)

The Core graph was seeded with a today-dated `event` (Calendar), an open `task` (Goals) and a `book` (Reader), then home was reloaded (persist rehydrate). PASS = the Today and Open Tasks widgets show the live count + entity, the jump-back-in strip lists all three newest-first, clicking a row lands in its owning app (the `openEntity` rail), and a question typed into the Cakra line opens Cakra prefilled (the `empire-ai-clipboard` rail). The pure selectors are unit-pinned in `bridge.test.ts`; this carries the rendered-home roundtrip jsdom cannot.

| Today widget | Tasks widget | Recents strip | Exact landing | Cakra line | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

**HOME-ALIVE: 1/1 ✅**

## Provenance-persists guard (EPIC-6 — durable app→app memory)

Real `editor→<target>` handoffs were fired from the Editor's ⚡ Send menu (each executor emits the honest event `flowForEvent` turns into an edge in the durable `empire-provenance` store), then the page was reloaded from a different route; PASS = the edge was recorded when the handoff fired AND survived the reload (rehydrated from the persisted ledger). This is the runtime realization of EPIC-6's "seed handoff → reload → durable source still shows" acceptance that jsdom cannot exercise (no real localStorage reload).

| Edge | Recorded | Persisted (reload) | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| editor→notes | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| editor→ai-chat | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| editor→prompt-generator | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

**PROVENANCE-PERSISTS: 3/3 ✅**

## Provenance-entity guard (EPIC-6 S3 — per-entity source survives reload)

Distinct from the edge guard above: each S3 receiver was seeded with an inbound payload, reloaded so it consumed the chip + prefilled, then its OWN create/send was triggered so the entity persisted its durable `from`; the page was reloaded again (chip now gone) and a `<LineageTrail>` ("From <source>") must still render off the persisted entity. This is the headline S3 acceptance jsdom cannot exercise.

| Entity edge | Trail after create | Trail after reload | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| calculator→goals | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| editor→messages | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| notes→calendar | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

**PROVENANCE-ENTITY: 3/3 ✅**

## Offline-boot guard (EPIC-4 S1 — cold boot from SW precache)

The built app was served, warm-loaded so the service worker precached, then ALL network was blocked (`setOffline`); each route below was navigated cold and must render purely from the precache. The precache audit cross-checks the SW manifest against every emitted chunk.

**Precache:** 85 manifest entries; 49 JS + 3 CSS chunks emitted — ✅ no gap (all chunks precached).

| Route | Renders offline |
|---|---|
| / | ✅ |
| /app/clock | ✅ |
| /app/maps | ✅ |
| /app/network | ✅ |
| /app/photos | ✅ |

**Cold-offline boot: 5/5 ✅**
