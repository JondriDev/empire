## QA verdict — EPIC-10 S1 (the Timeline lens) CONFIRMED LIVE · green main `3cfe846` · 2026-07-04

**No runtime bug found. No contradiction.** First independent QA since the last QA commit `5d45ce8`
(2026-07-03, EPIC-9 S3). Since then EPIC-9 was retired, EPIC-10 promoted, and **EPIC-10 S1 shipped
(`3cfe846`)** — this run is its first independent confirmation.

- **EPIC-10 S1 acceptance metric MOVED (reproduced without the builder's tree):** the `TIMELINE` guard is
  **1/1 ✅** (`ordered=true grouped=true flow=true persisted=true`) — two graph-survivable `task` nodes
  (distinct `meta.created`, two apps) + one `empire-provenance` edge seeded → reload → `/app/timeline`
  renders them newest-`created` first, under a `[data-timeline-day]` header, with the seeded edge as a
  `[data-timeline-kind=flow]` row, and it all survives a SECOND reload. Backed by `timeline.test.ts` (15
  cases). **★ S1 acceptance confirmed moved → S1 done-confirmed.**
- **Visually confirmed** (`app-timeline.png`): clock-glyph + "The organism's history, one stream · 2 moments"
  header, a **TODAY** sticky day group, two entity rows (accent dot + title + `dataset` type chip + `now`) —
  the 4th lens renders real organism data.
- **29/29 routes render clean** (desktop shell + 28 apps, 0 uncaught JS). Every other guard green:
  SHELL-IS-STYLED ✅, REGISTRY-COVERAGE 28 ✅ (bidirectional), INBOUND-LANDS 3/3, MEDIA-PERSISTS 3/3,
  GRAPH-LEGIBLE 1/1, GLOBAL-SEARCH 1/1 (`tagOnly=true`), NODE-LINEAGE 1/1 (5 axes), HOME-ALIVE 1/1,
  PROVENANCE-PERSISTS 3/3, PROVENANCE-ENTITY 3/3, OFFLINE-BOOT 5/5, PRECACHE 82 entries NO GAP.
- **Suite:** build 🟢 · **vitest 307/307** (33 files) 🟢 · `metrics.mjs --assert-zero` exit 0 (token
  violations 0, off-system 0).

**Metric deltas** (vs the builder's EPIC-10 S1 snapshot in `metrics.json` — reproduced exactly, Δ ±0):
apps **28** · routes **29/29 clean** · test cases **265 static / 307 vitest** · test files **31 static / 33
vitest** · token violations **0** · off-system **0** · bundle gz **703.5 KB**. All Δ ±0 — no regression from
the S1 snapshot; the last *QA-confirmed* baseline was 27 apps / 701.4 KB / vitest 292 (`0378d8e`, EPIC-9 S3),
so vs that this run reflects S1's intended +1 app (Timeline), +15 tests, +2.1 KB (no new deps).

**Console/network noise = env-expected, NOT bugs:** Weather geocoding + geolocation blocked (offline sandbox),
Maps carto tiles ERR_TUNNEL_CONNECTION_FAILED (blocked CDN — map container still renders), Files `/api/files`
HTTP 500 (Android-only backend). None is a render failure.

> **PASS** = the app rendered with no uncaught JS exception / error boundary / blank screen.
> Network & console noise (failed external CDN fetches, backend API calls needing auth) is
> listed separately — expected in the offline cloud sandbox and **not** a render failure.

## Inbound-lands guard (organism emit↔receive loop)

Each entity receiver was seeded with a cross-app payload + reloaded; PASS = a "Received from <source>" chip rendered AND a control was prefilled.

| Receiver | From | Chip | Prefilled | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| calendar | editor | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| goals | notes | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| messages | ai-chat | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Media-persists guard (EPIC-3 S2/S3 — IndexedDB blob roundtrip)

Each media app's real file `<input>` was driven with a small blob, then the page was reloaded; PASS = the item appeared after add AND survived the reload (rehydrated from IndexedDB, not dropped as a ghost). This exercises the S2 acceptance that jsdom cannot (no IndexedDB).

| App | Added | Survived reload | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| music | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| video | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| photos | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Graph-legible guard (EPIC-6 S4 — Reader's books join the organism)

Reader's real file `<input>` was driven with a small `.txt` book, then the persisted Core graph (`empire-core-graph`) was inspected; PASS = a `book` node owned by `app==='reader'` appeared AND survived a reload (the re-mounted Reader re-mirrors its library). This closes the last graph-island — every collection-owning app is now graph-legible.

| Collection | Node created | Survived reload | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| reader/book | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

**GRAPH-LEGIBLE: 1/1 ✅**

## Global-search guard (EPIC-8 S1 + S2 — the organism becomes queryable)

The Core graph was seeded with entities sharing a rare term across TWO apps (a `book` in Reader, a `task` in Goals); after a reload (persist rehydrate) the term was typed into the Search field. PASS = BOTH entities surface, grouped under their own app sections — one lens querying every app's real entities at once. **S2 adds a tag-only match:** a third node carries the term `Tessellate` ONLY in `data.tags` (a string array) — it surfaces iff `nodeBodyText` now flattens array elements (the S2 corpus gap). The pure ranking spine (`searchNodes`) is unit-pinned in `search.test.ts`; this carries the graph→input→grouped-render roundtrip jsdom cannot.

| Query | Book hit | Task hit | Spans 2 apps | Tag-only hit | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Xenolith / Tessellate | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

**GLOBAL-SEARCH: 1/1 ✅**

## Node-lineage guard (node-level lineage — per-artifact ancestry is legible)

App-level provenance remembers which app fed which app; node-level lineage answers which ENTITY an exact artifact descended from. The core intents stamp `data.from = sourceNode.id` on every node they create, so the graph already holds a durable per-artifact ancestry edge. Two graph-survivable `task` nodes were seeded — a parent and a child whose `data.from` points at it — then reloaded so the persist store rehydrated; PASS = the Inbox child row renders a `<NodeLineage>` (`[data-node-lineage]`) carrying the parent entity's real title, AND it still resolves after a second reload (the `from` link is durable). **S2 extends the surface:** the same seeded ancestry must ALSO render on the Search result row (query "anomaly" → the child hit shows `[data-node-lineage=qa-lineage-parent]`), proving `<NodeLineage>` is now legible on every node-rendering view, not just the Inbox — the same drop-in surface also mounts on The Network inspector's per-entity list (visual/on-device). The pure walker `nodeLineageOf` is unit-pinned in `nodeLineage.test.ts`; this carries the graph→persist→rehydrate→render roundtrip jsdom cannot.

 **S3 makes it NAVIGABLE:** each ancestry hop is a real `[role="button"]` that climbs to the source entity (`openEntity` → open its owning app + set the gaze); the guard asserts the parent hop renders as a focusable control whose accessible name targets the parent entity, then clicks it (the window/focus change is unit-pinned in `NodeLineage.test.tsx` — on the /app/search route AppShell renders by URL, so in-app navigation isn't observable headless).

| Artifact | Lineage rendered | Parent title shown | Survived reload | Search surface | Hop clickable | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| task ← Chart the Xenobloom anomaly | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

**NODE-LINEAGE: 1/1 ✅**

## Timeline guard (EPIC-10 S1 — the organism gets a TEMPORAL lens)

The Empire had three lenses over its one Core graph — Network (STRUCTURAL), Search (QUERY), Inbox (TASK) — but no way to see *when* it did things, even though every `CoreNode` stamps `meta.created` and every `ProvEdge` stamps `at`. The new Timeline app merges every entity-birth + every app→app handoff into one newest-first, day-grouped stream via the pure `buildTimeline`/`groupByDay`/`dayKey` spine (unit-pinned in `timeline.test.ts`). Two graph-survivable `task` nodes (distinct `meta.created`, owned by two apps) + one `empire-provenance` edge were seeded, then reloaded so BOTH persist stores rehydrated; PASS = the two entity rows render newest-`created` first (`ordered`), at least one `[data-timeline-day]` header renders (`grouped`), the seeded edge renders as a `[data-timeline-kind=flow]` row (`flow`), and all of it still holds after a SECOND reload (`persisted`). This carries the graph+ledger→persist→rehydrate→ordered-render roundtrip jsdom cannot; the sticky day headers + relative labels are the on-device visual.

| Ordered newest-first | Grouped by day | Flow row | Survived reload | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

**TIMELINE: 1/1 ✅**

## Home-alive guard (The Bridge — the home screen is living telemetry)

The Core graph was seeded with a today-dated `event` (Calendar), an open `task` (Goals) and a `book` (Reader), then home was reloaded (persist rehydrate). PASS = the Today and Open Tasks widgets show the live count + entity, the jump-back-in strip lists all three newest-first, clicking a row lands in its owning app (the `openEntity` rail), and a question typed into the Cakra line opens Cakra prefilled (the `empire-ai-clipboard` rail). The pure selectors are unit-pinned in `bridge.test.ts`; this carries the rendered-home roundtrip jsdom cannot.

| Today widget | Tasks widget | Recents strip | Exact landing | Cakra line | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

**HOME-ALIVE: 1/1 ✅**

## Provenance-persists guard (EPIC-6 — durable app→app memory)

Real `editor→<target>` handoffs were fired from the Editor's ⚡ Send menu (each executor emits the honest event `flowForEvent` turns into an edge in the durable `empire-provenance` store), then the page was reloaded from a different route; PASS = the edge was recorded when the handoff fired AND survived the reload (rehydrated from the persisted ledger). This is the runtime realization of EPIC-6's "seed handoff → reload → durable source still shows" acceptance that jsdom cannot exercise (no real localStorage reload).

| Edge | Recorded | Persisted (reload) | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| editor→notes | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| editor→ai-chat | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| editor→prompt-generator | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

**PROVENANCE-PERSISTS: 3/3 ✅**

## Provenance-entity guard (EPIC-6 S3 — per-entity source survives reload)

Distinct from the edge guard above: each S3 receiver was seeded with an inbound payload, reloaded so it consumed the chip + prefilled, then its OWN create/send was triggered so the entity persisted its durable `from`; the page was reloaded again (chip now gone) and a `<LineageTrail>` ("From <source>") must still render off the persisted entity. This is the headline S3 acceptance jsdom cannot exercise.

| Entity edge | Trail after create | Trail after reload | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| calculator→goals | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| editor→messages | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| notes→calendar | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

**PROVENANCE-ENTITY: 3/3 ✅**

## Offline-boot guard (EPIC-4 S1 — cold boot from SW precache)

The built app was served, warm-loaded so the service worker precached, then ALL network was blocked (`setOffline`); each route below was navigated cold and must render purely from the precache. The precache audit cross-checks the SW manifest against every emitted chunk.

**Precache:** 82 manifest entries; 47 JS + 3 CSS chunks emitted — ✅ no gap (all chunks precached).

| Route | Renders offline |
|---|---|
| / | ✅ |
| /app/clock | ✅ |
| /app/maps | ✅ |
| /app/network | ✅ |
| /app/photos | ✅ |

**Cold-offline boot: 5/5 ✅**
