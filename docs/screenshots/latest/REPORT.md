# Empire QA — Visual + Smoke Report

**Generated:** 2026-07-03T03:07:39.639Z

**Result:** 28/28 rendered without crash, 0 failed.

## QA verdict — EPIC-8 S2 done-confirmed LIVE (green main `1db665e`)

First independent QA since **EPIC-8 S2** landed (`1db665e`; last QA `ce30e4e` confirmed S1 on `ac6af7b`,
with the strategy doc `88e2689` also landing since). Built from a fresh checkout, served `dist/`, ran the full
headless smoke end-to-end. **No runtime bug, no contradiction.**

- **28/28 routes render clean** (desktop shell + 27 apps, 0 uncaught JS), incl. Search (`app-search.png`) —
  styled field + "Find anything, anywhere" empty state; the launcher grid (`desktop.png`) shows all 24 tiles.
- **EPIC-8 S2 acceptance metric MOVED (done-confirmed):** the `GLOBAL-SEARCH` guard now reproduces
  **`tagOnly=true`** independently — a node carrying `Tessellate` ONLY in `data.tags` (a string array) surfaces,
  proving `nodeBodyText` now flattens array elements (the S2 corpus gap). `book=true task=true twoApps=true
  tagOnly=true`, groups `reader,goals` → **GLOBAL-SEARCH 1/1 ✅**. Backed by `search.test.ts` array-flatten +
  tag-only cases (**vitest 255 → 257**). S2's "land on exact entity" (`openEntity` + `.focus-land` ring) is
  unit-pinned + on-device visual (a fresh-checkout corpus is graph-only — see the TRAP in CONTEXT.md).
- **Metric deltas vs last QA snapshot (`ac6af7b`, S1):** apps 27 (±0), vitest **255 → 257 (+2)**, static
  test-cases **213 → 215 (+2)**, test files 27/29 (±0), token-violations **0** (±0), off-system **0** (±0,
  `metrics.mjs --assert-zero` exit 0), bundle gz **696.0 → 696.4 (+0.4** — S2's array-flatten + `openEntity` +
  Notes focus-land, no new deps).
- **All other guards green:** SHELL-IS-STYLED ✅, REGISTRY-COVERAGE ✅ (27 apps, bidirectional), INBOUND 3/3,
  MEDIA-PERSISTS 3/3, GRAPH-LEGIBLE 1/1, PROVENANCE-PERSISTS 3/3, PROVENANCE-ENTITY 3/3, OFFLINE-BOOT 5/5,
  PRECACHE 80 entries no-gap.
- **Env-expected noise (NOT bugs):** weather geocoding API + geolocation (blocked/authed), `files` `/api/files`
  500 (Android-only backend), maps CARTO tiles (egress-blocked → grey tiles over a real Leaflet container).

> **PASS** = the app rendered with no uncaught JS exception / error boundary / blank screen.
> Network & console noise (failed external CDN fetches, backend API calls needing auth) is
> listed separately — expected in the offline cloud sandbox and **not** a render failure.

## Inbound-lands guard (organism emit↔receive loop)

Each entity receiver was seeded with a cross-app payload + reloaded; PASS = a "Received from <source>" chip rendered AND a control was prefilled.

| Receiver | From | Chip | Prefilled | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| calendar | editor | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| goals | notes | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| messages | ai-chat | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Media-persists guard (EPIC-3 S2/S3 — IndexedDB blob roundtrip)

Each media app's real file `<input>` was driven with a small blob, then the page was reloaded; PASS = the item appeared after add AND survived the reload (rehydrated from IndexedDB, not dropped as a ghost). This exercises the S2 acceptance that jsdom cannot (no IndexedDB).

| App | Added | Survived reload | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| music | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| video | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| photos | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Graph-legible guard (EPIC-6 S4 — Reader's books join the organism)

Reader's real file `<input>` was driven with a small `.txt` book, then the persisted Core graph (`empire-core-graph`) was inspected; PASS = a `book` node owned by `app==='reader'` appeared AND survived a reload (the re-mounted Reader re-mirrors its library). This closes the last graph-island — every collection-owning app is now graph-legible.

| Collection | Node created | Survived reload | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| reader/book | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

**GRAPH-LEGIBLE: 1/1 ✅**

## Global-search guard (EPIC-8 S1 + S2 — the organism becomes queryable)

The Core graph was seeded with entities sharing a rare term across TWO apps (a `book` in Reader, a `task` in Goals); after a reload (persist rehydrate) the term was typed into the Search field. PASS = BOTH entities surface, grouped under their own app sections — one lens querying every app's real entities at once. **S2 adds a tag-only match:** a third node carries the term `Tessellate` ONLY in `data.tags` (a string array) — it surfaces iff `nodeBodyText` now flattens array elements (the S2 corpus gap). The pure ranking spine (`searchNodes`) is unit-pinned in `search.test.ts`; this carries the graph→input→grouped-render roundtrip jsdom cannot.

| Query | Book hit | Task hit | Spans 2 apps | Tag-only hit | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Xenolith / Tessellate | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

**GLOBAL-SEARCH: 1/1 ✅**

## Provenance-persists guard (EPIC-6 — durable app→app memory)

Real `editor→<target>` handoffs were fired from the Editor's ⚡ Send menu (each executor emits the honest event `flowForEvent` turns into an edge in the durable `empire-provenance` store), then the page was reloaded from a different route; PASS = the edge was recorded when the handoff fired AND survived the reload (rehydrated from the persisted ledger). This is the runtime realization of EPIC-6's "seed handoff → reload → durable source still shows" acceptance that jsdom cannot exercise (no real localStorage reload).

| Edge | Recorded | Persisted (reload) | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| editor→notes | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| editor→ai-chat | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| editor→prompt-generator | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

**PROVENANCE-PERSISTS: 3/3 ✅**

## Provenance-entity guard (EPIC-6 S3 — per-entity source survives reload)

Distinct from the edge guard above: each S3 receiver was seeded with an inbound payload, reloaded so it consumed the chip + prefilled, then its OWN create/send was triggered so the entity persisted its durable `from`; the page was reloaded again (chip now gone) and a `<LineageTrail>` ("From <source>") must still render off the persisted entity. This is the headline S3 acceptance jsdom cannot exercise.

| Entity edge | Trail after create | Trail after reload | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| calculator→goals | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| editor→messages | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| notes→calendar | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

**PROVENANCE-ENTITY: 3/3 ✅**

## Offline-boot guard (EPIC-4 S1 — cold boot from SW precache)

The built app was served, warm-loaded so the service worker precached, then ALL network was blocked (`setOffline`); each route below was navigated cold and must render purely from the precache. The precache audit cross-checks the SW manifest against every emitted chunk.

**Precache:** 80 manifest entries; 45 JS + 3 CSS chunks emitted — ✅ no gap (all chunks precached).

| Route | Renders offline |
|---|---|
| / | ✅ |
| /app/clock | ✅ |
| /app/maps | ✅ |
| /app/network | ✅ |
| /app/photos | ✅ |

**Cold-offline boot: 5/5 ✅**
